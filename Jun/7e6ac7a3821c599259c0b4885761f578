The Christian Association of Nigeria has alerted Nigerians over planned wave of attacks to be unleashed on Southern Kaduna and other areas dominated by Christians in some states of the Middle Belt region. Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, spokesman to CAN President, Rev Dr Samson Ayokunle, in a statement sent to media houses on Wednesday said Southern Kaduna Chiefdom and towns that include Gumel, Dagwarga, Daddu, Mariri, Kagoro, hotels, Open University and other soft targets, among others, are being targeted. He said, “While we are prone to dismiss these planned attacks as products of figments of imagination, we are, however, constrained to call the attention of President Muhammadu Buhari and other security agencies to be aware and take precautionary measures. “Having witnessed unprecedented human carnage on the Plateau, we call on President Buhari to place the security agencies on red alert in order to avoid a similar recurrence. “While we are happy at the statement credited to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo that perpetrators of the Plateau carnage would not be allowed to escape justice, we are quick to remind and appeal to the Federal Government to at least stand by its promise to ensure that these blood-thirsty herdsmen are brought to book to face the full wrath of the law. “As the umbrella organisation for all Christians in Nigeria, we are at pains at the tragedy that has befallen our members. We mourn the death of over 200 Christians slaughtered on the Plateau at the weekend and we passionately appeal to the Buhari-led Administration to rise up and put a stop to further killings of innocent people, including defenseless women and children. “Following the killings that took place on the Plateau, CAN has obtained reliable information on the number of dead as recorded in B/Ladi & Riyom LGAs from Sat. 23rd to Monday 25th June, 2018 “1.

We urge them to be pro-active in doing their jobs. Mobilising troops and policemen after the havoc has been done does not make sense. A government that cannot protect the citizens is a failed government. “CAN is, once again calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to replace all the security chiefs and the Inspector General of Police because they have overstayed their welcome. It is ridiculous and embarrassing that in the last three years, none of these criminals have been apprehended, detained, arraigned and convicted. “This is what is emboldening them to kill the innocent with impunity. We are approaching a state of anarchy faster than we can imagine. Why are we following the footpath of Rwanda daily with these unprecedented killings and mass burials when we are not at war?ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.”
