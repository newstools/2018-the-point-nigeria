A 70-year-old man, Boluwaji Adenugba, has reportedly committed suicide at Ore town, in the Odigbo Local Government Area of Ondo State. The late Adenugba, who was said to be retired a military officer, reportedly shot himself in his house with a dane gun on Tuesday after returning home from the bush where he had gone for hunting. Although the reason for the action was yet to be ascertained as of press time, eyewitness told newsmen that the deceased had a minor disagreement with one of his daughters, which led to an argument between them. He said, “As the argument was ongoing, he rushed into his room in annoyance and locked the door from the back. “He later shot himself dead with a dane gun in his room. “When neighbours heard the gunshot, they rushed to the room, forced the door open and saw him in a pool of blood.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Femi Joseph, confirmed the incident. “We have commenced investigation into the matter,” the PPRO added.
