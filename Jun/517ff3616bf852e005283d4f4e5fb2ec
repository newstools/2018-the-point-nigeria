Senator Shehu Sani has expressed his support for the unopposed aspirant for the national chairmanship of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole. Sani, however, condemned the administration of the outgoing National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, alleging that it was characterised by crises. The lawmaker, in a statement issued in Abuja on Saturday, said Oshiomhole, who would be adopted as Odigie-Oyegun’s successor at the ongoing national congress of the APC, would revive the party. Sani said, “In the last three years under Oyegun, APC oscillated between Libya, Syria and Yemen situations. In the last three years, APC’s broom was stained by the feces of inequalities and glued by the mucus of injustices. In the last three years, APC became an unruly ruling party presiding over ruins of its sub-chapters. “Chief Oyegun is leaving behind an APC that he fashioned and erected on a heap of fraudulent congresses, cold war, and civil war. Chief Oyegun is leaving behind hatchets buried with leaves. Chief Oyegun is literally leaving behind grenades covered with flowers of which Comrade Adams must detonate. “In the last three years under the outgoing leadership of the party, APC’s Broom was unable to clean the political space and even itself but it rather became part of the nation’s refuse and sewage waste. “I believe Comrade Adams can take the party out of the woods and lead it to a new path and a new future. However, I advise that Adams must resist the blackmail and the stranglehold of the Lucifers within the party.”
