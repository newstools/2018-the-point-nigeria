The Ekiti State Police Command has dismissed claims that the convoys of the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbjo and that of the All Progressives Congress Candidate, Dr Kayode Fayemi knocked down a police officer. The Command’s Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Caleb Nwachukwu, told newsmen that a Toyota Sienna Van with registration number: Lagos X2874 Eky knocked down two pedestrians on Bashiri road just before the newly constructed overhead bridge in Ado-Ekiti. Those affected in the accident were one Anayomi Ismailia and a yet to be identified police officer. He said: “the convoy of the Vice President and Fayemi came in through the Ikere axis of the State capital around 12 noon, while the incident in question happened around 9am.”
