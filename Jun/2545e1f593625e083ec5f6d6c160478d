The Atiku Abubakar presidential campaign group of the Peoples Democratic Party has declared that Nigeria’s political landscape would continue to be dominated by older politicians because of their experiences and ability to resist financial inducement. The National Coordinator of the group, Rev. ‘Sola Salawu, made the declaration in Abeokuta, the Ogun state capital while speaking  after the inauguration of the state chapter of the group. With particular reference to contesting the presidential seat in Nigeria, Salawu said present realities in the country had shown that only few Nigerian youths would not sell out when offered with tempting monetary inducement. Salawu, who spoke against the backdrop of President Buhari’s warning that youths should wait till year 2023, however, maintained that the country needed experienced and well-grounded politician as president, to manage the multi-faceted challenges currently bedevilling the country. Salawu, who is also the Chairman of  Ogun state Working Committee of Atiku Abubakar for President 2019, was however, of the opinion that youths in Nigerian politics need to first exhibit  readines to administer the affairs of the country by contesting for governorship seat of their respective states before aspiring for the presidential seat. “It has been proved that an average Nigerian youth needs flashy cars and good houses. But for them to aspire to be president of Nigeria, let us see them first contesting the governorship seats at the state level, without bowing to tempting financial inducement,” he stressed.
