Operatives of the Federal Anti-Robbery Squad in Ogun have arrested a member of the state House of Assembly representing Remo North State Constituency, Adebiyi Adeleye, alongside 18 other persons. This is coming less than 24 hours after the lawmaker accused the Majority Leader of the House, Yinka Mafe, of an alleged attempt on his life on the orders of the state government. Mafe has since debunked the allegation as a cheap blackmail, saying he had no reason to go after his colleague. Adeleye was arrested at his constituency office in Isara, Remo North, with his supporters at about 7pm on Monday. They were subsequently taken to the headquarters of FSARS in Magbon, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. It was further gathered that the lawmaker was not aware of the initial reason for his arrest but he, alongside others, were later made to write statements bearing on alleged thuggery, cultism and unlawful possession of firearms. A source closer to the lawmaker said they were arrested with allegation of ‘assembly likely to cause public unrest.’ It was further gathered that when they were taken before the officer-in-charge of the formation, he reportedly said they were arrested on allegation of robbery and attempted murder. Although the lawmaker could not be immediately reached, the source hinted that plan was on top gear to institute a fundamental human right suit against the police.
