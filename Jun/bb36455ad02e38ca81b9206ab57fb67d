…dismisses reports he’s been flown abroad for further treatment The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the July 14 Governorship election in Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has named a former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Michael Opeyemi Bamidele (alias MOB), as the Director General of his campaign organisation. Fayemi disclosed this at the inauguration of members of the various Standing Committees for the election. He also alleged fresh plots by the ruling People’s Democratic Party in the state to unleash terror on his supporters across the state. Fayemi told journalists during a press conference at the APC Secretariat in Ado-Ekiti that Bamidele had agreed in principle to serve as the director general of his campaign organisation before the unfortunate shooting incident. Bamidele was shot along with five others at APC Office in Ado-Ekiti during a welcome rally held for Fayemi. The former Minister of Mines and Steel Development also dismissed report that Bamidele had been flown abroad for further medical treatment. He explained that Bamidele was still at an undisclosed private hospital in Lagos. Fayemi said, “I am glad to inform you that Bamidele had accepted to serve as Director General of our campaign before the unfortunate shooting incident and we have decided to retain him.I want to also clarify that Bamidele is still in Lagos and he has not been flown abroad. “I hope what the shooting incident on June 1 at our party office is not a poniter to what happen in the nearest future. This is because we had intelligence report that  some people are planning to cause mayhem across the state and we had shared the information with the security agencies.”
