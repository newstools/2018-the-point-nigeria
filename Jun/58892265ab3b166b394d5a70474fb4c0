Mr. Rotimi Amaechi and Senator Magnus Abe embraced each other at the national convention of the APC. Political differences in Rivers State had pitched the former allies against each other. Abe, who arrived at the stand allocated to the delegates from his state unheralded, received a cold reception from the delegates. The former governor of the state and current minister of transportation was already seated among the delegates when Abe arrived. The senator, however, went ahead to greet Amaechi,Â  who in turn stood up to shake hands with the former commissioner for information in the state.
