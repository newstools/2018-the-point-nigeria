Senators and members of the House of Representatives held a joint executive session at the National Assembly. The President of the Senate, Senator Bukola Saraki, and the Speaker of the House, Mr. Yakubu Dogara, are presided over the session. The agenda was unknown, but insiders said it may not be unconnected with the withdrawal of some Department of State Service security operatives attached to Saraki and Dogara. The face-off between the Police and Saraki, who is the Chairman of the National Assembly, was said to be a likely item on the agenda. The meeting started at 12.43pm.
