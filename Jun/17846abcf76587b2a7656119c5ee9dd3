A housewife, Ijeoma Onyemaechi, has allegedly attacked and injured her husband with a broken bottle in the Ajegunle area of Lagos, for taking another lady on a date at a beer parlour. Ijeoma was said to have met her husband, Andrew Onyemaechi, with the young woman, identified as Agatha, in a beer parlour along Kirikiri Road, drinking pepper soup and beer. An eyewitness, Gloria Uwaoma, told our correspondent that the couple, living at Idewu Street, Ajegunle, had been having disagreements over money for cooking and the upkeep of their three children, before the incident. “The woman was angry with her husband, who she accused of not giving her enough money to take care of the home. The woman complained that the man gave her only N1000 to cook soup. Whenever she complained, it would result in a quarrel. But now, he had enough money to take his lover called Agatha to a beer parlour, buy her big stout and pepper soup. Instead of taking good care of his wife and children, he decided to spend his money on other women, which is very bad,” she said. Uwaoma said when Ijeoma caught her husband with the lady at the beer parlour, she did not hesitate to deal with him, adding that she immediately picked up an empty beer bottle and hit it on her husband’s head and he was soaked in his own blood from the injuries he sustained. “Immediately the woman saw both of them drinking pepper soup and beer, she quickly took the bottle, broke it on her husband’s head, but the lady took to her heels. The woman ran after her, but she escaped. Blood was gushing out of the man’s head. As the woman explained why she took such an action against her husband, many people began to blame the man. They called him an irresponsible man, who left his wife at home to run after other women,” she said.
