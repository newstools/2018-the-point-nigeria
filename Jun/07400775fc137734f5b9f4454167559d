Mr Lasun Yussuff, the Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, has declared his intention to vie for the September 22 governorship election in Osun state. Yussuff, who made the declaration at the All Progressives Congress secretariat in Osogbo on Thursday, said he was the man for the job. He said there was no sign that he would not perform creditably if given the opportunity to govern the state. The deputy speaker, who noted that he had been one of the loyal party members, said that the people of the state were waiting for him to govern them. Yussuff said that he would generate more employment opportunities in the state by leveraging on the Osun Youth Empowerment Scheme legacy of Gov. Rauf Aregbesola. He said he would ensure that the OYES scheme was backed by legislation in the state. Yussuff also said that he would engage in manpower training in the education sector, embark on agricultural revolution and improve on the Internally Generated Revenue of the state. “I am not fighting to be governor, but rather I want to be the governor because I have the experience and the exposure. “The people of the state want me and are waiting for me to rule them because I am the one the cap fits and I will not disappoint them,” Yussuff said. Welcoming the aspirant to the party secretariat, Mr Gboyega Famodun, the state party chairman, said there was no doubt that the aspirant has the political exposure and experience to rule the state. Famodun, while admonishing the aspirant to play politics with all sense of humility, urged him to heed both the public and private advice he had been given him. “If it is the will of God for you to be the governor, so be it, but one thing that is sure is that it is only one person that will pick the party’s ticket for the election,’’ Famodun said. 27 aspirants under the platform of the APC have so far expressed their intention to contest the party’s primaries ahead of the gubernatorial election.
