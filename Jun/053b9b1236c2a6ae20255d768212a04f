The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, has felicitated with Muslims all over the world on the successful completion of this year’s Ramadan fasting. Ooni’s felicitation is contained in a statement signed by his Director of Media and Public Affairs, Mr. Moses Olafare, in Ile-Ife, Osun State, on Friday. Ogunwusi charged Muslims to imbibe the spirit of religious tolerance to enable them to coexist peacefully with the adherents of other religious faiths. The monarch described Ramadan as a month of purity and faithfulness for the Muslims all over the world. He urged Muslims to emulate Prophet Mohammed, who remains an embodiment of the tenets of Qur’an and principles of Ramadan. Oba Ogunwusi, while admonishing the Muslim faithful to abstain from any act of ungodliness, bemoaned the attitude of some people in positions of authority, who during or after Ramadan, refuse to desist from ungodly acts. The monarch said, “I sent my warm greetings to our Muslim brothers and sisters in Yorubaland; across the continent of Africa and all over the world. “I fervently believe you all have fulfilled the spiritual obligations attached to the holy Ramadan and come out with renewed spiritual energy, purified heart of kindness and forgiveness. “You must rededicate yourselves to the service of the Almighty Allah and humanity. “Purify your souls, repent your wrongdoings, observe self-sacrifices and devote your attentions to peaceful coexistence with members of other religious sects, as all human beings serve one single God.” The monarch, who is also the spiritual leader of Yorubaland, is currently on a two-week peace and unity visit to Brazil. He went in company with an entourage comprising some chiefs, including 17 notable Yoruba traditional rulers drawn from Nigeria’s southwest states. Among those who accompanied the Ooni abroad are traditional rulers, scholars, priests and the members of Herbal Therapy Society of Nigeria led by Chief Akintunde Ayeni.
