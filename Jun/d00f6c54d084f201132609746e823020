Manchester United will make David de Gea the highest paid goalkeeper in the world after club and the player reached an agreement over a new contract. The 27-year-old has long been linked with a move back to his homeland with European Champions, Real Madrid. But Spanish outlet, Marca reports that the Old Trafford landlords have been locked in talks with De Gea and have agreed a bumper £18.4m-a-year contract with the keeper. That is around £350k-a-week which eclipses the £13m Bayern Munich goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer takes home. It makes the Spaniard the highest paid keeper in the world. Jose Mourinho has been keen to tie up De Gea’s future and ward off interest from Real. Although De Gea has agreed to the terms, he will not sign the contract until after the World Cup. Real Madrid have, however, shifted their attention to Roma and Brazil No.1 Alisson, and will need to stump up a record sum for a keeper.
