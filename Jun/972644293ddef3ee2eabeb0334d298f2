Voting for the next edition will begin in November 2018 and will be on through early December. “The next award ceremony in Lagos will attract top football stars, officials and music artistes. We have already begun preparations to make the award night one to remember for a long time. “We are especially grateful to Amaju Pinnick and his team in the Nigeria Football Federation and all sport journalists across the 36 states of Nigeria, who have demonstrated relentless commitment and unflinching support for the Nigeria Pitch Awards,” Philips explained. The Nigeria Pitch Awards has rewarded excellence and talent among Nigerian footballers and stakeholders since 2013 when its maiden edition was held in Calabar.
