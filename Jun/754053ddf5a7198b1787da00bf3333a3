The Chairman of Lucinda Media Limited (owners of Sweet 107.1FM), Abeokuta, Ogun State, Senator Olugbenga Obadara, has charged political office holders and businessmen across Nigeria to always exercise restraint in handling funds. Obadara made this call in his Sallah Message to Nigerians, noting that the Muslim Faithful had in the last one month shown a noteworthy example of restraint from food. He said this advice had become imperative at a time when people were speaking out against corrupt practices at all levels. “We must exercise restraint from funds that do not belong to us. Let us charge our political leaders to be honest and ensure same in our businesses,” Obadara said. The media mogul further stressed that the media had a major role to play in the fight against corrupt practices at all levels. “The media has a major role to play in ensuring that we put our leaders on their toes; whatever happened to watchdog reporting and interpretative journalism,” Obadara said. He also called on Nigerians to avoid religious and ethnic bigotry, saying, “Beyond our ethnicity and religiosity should come our humanity. We are first human before we are Yoruba or Christians.” He expressed optimism that Nigeria would be back on track and join the league of developed nations soon. “We will join the league of developed nations soon. I am optimistic and I call on Nigerians to get their PVCs and cast votes devoid of money politics,” Obadara said.
