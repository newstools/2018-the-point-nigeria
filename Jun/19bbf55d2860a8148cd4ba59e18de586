The Senate has praised President Muhammadu Buhari for honouring the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993, presidential election, the late Chief MKO Abiola and his running mate, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe. President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, said that the recognition was long overdue. Some senators urged Buhari to take a step further by making the date a national holiday. They also urged the President to order the Independent National Electoral Commission to announce the results of the election, declare Abiola and Kingibe president and vice-president respectively, and approve the entitlements due to them.
