The Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources in Lagos State, Mr Olawale Oluwo, has announced his resignation from the All Progressives Congress. Mr Oluwo made the announcement in a resignation letter sent to Media houses on Wednesday. In the letter dated December 3 and addressed to the APC Chairman in the state, he explained that he took the decision as a result of the events played out at the party’s state primary held in October. Oluwo alleged that the exercise was characterised by voter disenfranchisement, undue influence, violence, and intimidation to members among other activities that violate the electoral law. He also claimed that the party lacked integrity, stressing that this has diminished the reputation of the state as a reference point for free and fair democratic practice. The APC leadership in the state has yet to respond to Oluwo’s allegations.
