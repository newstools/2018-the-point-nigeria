The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has sworn in three lawmakers elected under the platform of the All Progressives Congress to the House. The oath of office was administered on the new lawmakers by the Speaker on Wednesday. The new members are: Yusuf Nuhu (Bauchi, Toro Federal Constituency), Tunji Olawuyi (Kwara, Irepodun/Isin/Oke Ero/Ekiti Federal Constituency) and Abubakar Kusada (Katsina, Kankia/Kusada Federal Constituency). They were recently elected to fill vacant seats in their various constituencies. Two of the seats (Katsina and Bauchi) were recently declared vacant by the Speaker after the former occupants were elected senators. The former occupant of Irepodun/Isin/Oke Ero/Ekiti federal constituency of Kwara State, Funke Adedoyin, died in September after a brief illness. Meanwhile, a lawmaker from Anambra State, Gabriel Onyewife, defected from the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
