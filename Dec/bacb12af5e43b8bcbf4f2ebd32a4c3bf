His Royal Highness, Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Umar Ibn Garbai Elkanemi, has denied the claims by security operatives that the ongoing military operations in some parts of the state were yielding positive result. According to him, even in Maiduguri, our people cannot move out of the city beyond 5 kilometres without being attacked, killed or kidnapped by insurgents. He revealed this during a courtesy by President Muhammadu Buhari before the president proceeded to the Chief of Army Staff Annual Conference. Though he commeded President Buhari in the fight against Boko Haram, he however pointed out that they need to do more. “We plead that the federal government and the security agencies review the strategies in nipping this lingering crisis in the bud.”
