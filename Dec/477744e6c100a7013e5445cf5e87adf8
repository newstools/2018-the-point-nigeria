The family of late Nigeria’s Second Republic President, Shehu Shagari has released his burial details. Shagari died at the National Hospital Abuja on Friday after a brief illness. The late ex-President’s grandson, Nuradeen Mahe disclosed that Shagari will be buried on Saturday in Sokoto State. Addressing journalists in Sokoto, Mahe said Shagari’s “remains would be flown to Sokoto for burial on Saturday according to Islamic rites.” Mahe said the late President was moved to the National Hospital, Abuja on December 25, when “his health worsened, but he later died after being attended to by medical experts.” The former president ruled Nigeria between 1979 to 1983. Shagari, who won his second term election was, however, overthrowned by a coup d’etat that brought in Muhammadu Buhari as Military Head of State.
