With the knowledge that family planning can reduce maternal deaths and enhance the economy of the nation, the Chairman Senate Committee on Health, Olarenwa Tejuosho, has called on the executive to release the additional one million dollars meant for Family Planning services in Nigeria. Tejuosho (APC-Ogun) made the call at the 5th Nigeria Family Planning Conference in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory.
He assured Nigerians that access to Family Planning services would help reduce mortality rates in the society. He therefore admonished the government, private sector and other stakeholders to improve on the accessibility of Family Planning products. He said that family planning was a major contributor in the progress of Nigeria, saying it would help reduce the nation’s populace. “If we continue to allow the families to grow, it means we are heading to doom.” “The most important thing is the “green dot’’ and every woman should be encouraged to walk into any outlet with the green dot to access family planning services,” he said. The chairman also said that it was important for the nation to improve on her FP purposes in order to reach its full potential, saying that investment in FP is one of the smartest investments in achieving demographic dividend.
