 The Nigerian Muslim ummah, under the leadership of the President-General of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) and Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, has felicitated with our Christian compatriots on the occasion of 2018 Christmas. “As you celebrate this important milestone of high spiritual import, the Muslim community wishes you God’s guidance and abundant blessings embedded in the festive season.” In a release signed by Prof. Salisu Shehu,Deputy Secretary-General, on behalf of the NSCIA, he noted that the occasion of the commemoration of the birth of Jesus (PBUH) provides us another opportunity to thank God for His blessings to us as a nation and to renew our prayers for the restoration of peace and security to all parts of our dear country. “As you pray and celebrate, we join you in prayers as we beseech the Almighty God to make Nigeria overcome her current challenges and grant us peaceful, successful, fair and credible elections in the coming months.” Prophet ‘Isa (PBUH) or Jesus is one of the top-ranking Prophets of God that all Muslims venerate. In fact, the Qur’an mentions his name more than 25 times (i.e. Q. 2:87; 2:136; 2:253; 3:45; 3:52; 3:55; 3:59; 3:84; 4:157;  4:163; 4:171; 5:46; 5:78; 5:112; 5:114; 5:116; 6:85; 19:34; 33:7; 42:13; 43:57; 43:61; 43:63; 57:27; 61:6 and 61:14). Though his personality or divinity may be viewed differently by the teeming adherents of Christianity and Islam, the fact remains that in Jesus Christ, all of us, Christians and Muslims alike, have a role model, an exemplar and a symbol of our commonality as a people of faith. “As millions of Christians in our country mark the birth of Jesus (PBUH), we pray that the occasion engenders a new beginning of faithfulness, sincerity, righteousness, love, forgiveness and other virtues that he represents in our country. We indeed urge all Nigerians to emulate him and other true Prophets of God.”
