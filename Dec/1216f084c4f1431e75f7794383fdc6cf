His Imperial Majesty, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, has once again demonstrated his commitment to put smiles on the faces of less privileged children in the society as he organised a Christmas party for over 1,000 of them in Lagos. The monarch, through his Pet project, Hopes Alive Initiatives, which commenced operation in December 2017 as a social advocacy platform to alleviate the economic, cultural and environmental challenges of reducing the impact on the global society, has put smiles on the faces of many indigent children in this year alone. It would be recalled that Ooni recently visited the largest Internally Displaced Persons camp in Wassa, Abuja which hosts over 5,000 persons where he donated drugs and erected a football pitch to promote social activities among the refugees displaced by Boko Haram insurgency. This was shortly after he donated a vocational centre to some destitute in Umuahia, Abia State barely two weeks after his donation of a new home to an orphanage in Ibadan, Oyo State. Speaking at the Christmas programme , the Deputy Convener and Chief Executive of HAI, Princess Temitope Adesegun, said it’s the role of the initiative to put permanent smiles on the faces of these set of people especially at this season of love. “That is what we stand for, that is what gives his Imperial Majesty joy, to give them a new beginning, a sense of belonging, not temporarily but a long lasting memory that will change their entire sense of bearing, that will change their orientation, that will change their true essence and they will believe indeed and in truth they can actually live a well and beautiful life,” she said. The Head Operations of the organisation, Mr. Chidi Amos, explained that the ultimate aim of Hopes Alive Initiative was to give hope to the hopeless, saying “we support good intention, most especially,  ones that has to do with children.”
