A prominent Makurdi-based businessman, Chief Sylvester Kanu, and one other (name not given) have been abducted by unknown persons suspected to be kidnappers last Monday, December 10, in Imo State. While giving an update to The Point newspaper on Thursday in Makurdi, the elder brother to one of the hostages, Christian Kanu, lamented the plight of his brother saying he was worried about his safety. He expressed worries that his brother has since been denied access to his family as well as privilege to his fundamental human rights by his abductors. According to him, his brother who is also a unit Chairman of the Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) in Markurdi was billed to attend an official engagement in company with the Secretary of the association, Mr. Sunday Inouoha, when they were attacked midway to their journey and whisked away to an unknown destination. He said: “They were attacked and apprehended by the suspected kidnappers in Arondizuogu in Imo State”. He alleged that the suspected kidnappers forcefully overtook their victims’ vehicle, overpowered them and drove them to an unknown destination. He added that the captors demanded a N50million ransom for his brother’s release, saying that negotiation is still in progress. Kanu’s elder brother said that the matter had not been reported to the police since they were whisked away to an unknown destination. He, however, said efforts were being intensify to ensure their release. The Benue State Police Commissioner, Ene Okon, told The Point newspaper that there was a little his Command could do as the incident took place outside his jurisdiction.
