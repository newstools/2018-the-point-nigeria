Senate President,  Sen. Bukola Saraki, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt.Hon. Yakubu Dogara, have described  vote buying as a threat to the nation’s democracy. The two National Assembly Principal Officers made this known on Monday  at a public hearing in Abuja. The duo called for urgent action by stakeholders, especially security agencies to check the menace before the 2019 general election. The hearing  which was conducted by the National Assembly Joint Committee on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Abuja. Delivering his keynote address,  Senate President said the country was in a delicate situation as the entire world was looking forward to what would happen in the coming general election. This, he said, is understandable considering that President Muhammadu Buhari is the current Chairman of the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS). “Moreover, the Chairman of INEC is the head of Electoral Commissions in West Africa. “With these positions, it is clear that we cannot afford to conduct an election that will not be credible, peaceful, free and fair. “It is noteworthy that in 2015, we set an enviable standard that encouraged more countries in Africa to democratize. “In 2019, we cannot lower the standard. We must up the ante, because whatever we do will have impact on the continent and serve as a representation of Africa on the global stage,” he said. Saraki noted that the country could not afford to send wrong signals with its actions or inactions in the build-up to the election. He said that Nigeria must tell the world in action that it was ready to improve its electoral process by making it more transparent .
