  The Deputy President of the Senate, Sen. Ike Ekweremadu, on Thursday, said that there is no any particular statistics in respect of how many APC or PDP members are in the Senate. Ekweremadu made this known on the floor of the Senate during plenary presided over by him while reacting to the point of order raised by the Majority Leader, Sen. Ahmed Lawan representing APC-Yobe, who claimed that there were 56 APC senators as against PDP’s 46 in the upper chamber. But Ekweremadu reportedly countered him, saying there was no record to back his claim. “On the issue of the number, I don’t think there is any particular statistics in respect of how many APC or PDP members are in the Senate.” Lawan’s point of order was said to be in reaction to two reports on page 5 and page 7 of Daily Trust newspaper of Wednesday which he dismissed as erroneous. He said, “On page 5 of Daily Trust of Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2018, it is reported that the APC senators are 57 and PDP senators, 58. “For the record, Mr President, APC senators are 56 and PDP senators are 46.
