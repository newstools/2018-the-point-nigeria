Wife of the President, Dr. Aisha Buhari, has claimed that two powerful personalities were frustrating President Muhammadu Buhari’s effort. She said her husband’s administration had “achieved a lot but could have achieved more or even achieved all it had in one year but for two people in government who will never allow things to move fast.” Aisha said that she was “disappointed in men who rather than fight these two men will go to them in the night begging for favour.” Mrs. Buhari called on Nigerian women to rise and fight, adding, “I have realized that Senator Babafemi Ojodu, Special Adviser, political, to the President, and Dr. Hajo Sani, and wife of the Vice-President, Mrs Osinbajo, are not comfortable with my saying this and want me to confine myself to my prepared speech but we must say the truth.” The President’s wife insisted that the powerful duo were retrogressive elements preventing the government from moving forward.
