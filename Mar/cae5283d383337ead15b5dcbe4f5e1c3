No fewer than 84 persons benefited from a poverty alleviation programme, courtesy of a member representing Ikpoba Okha /Egor federal constituency, Edo State, Hon.  Ehiozuwa  Agbonnayinma, at the
weekend. The gesture, it was gathered, was worth over
N10 million. Speaking at the All Progressives Congress state secretariat, venue of the event, the federal lawmaker said the empowerment gesture, a few days after he also gave out 10 vehicles to his supporters, was geared at collaborating with Governor Godwin Obaseki, to reduce poverty considerably. He said the empowerment was in fulfillment of his electoral promise to reach out to humanity, adding that beneficiaries were indigent Edo indigenes, irrespective of party affiliations. Ehiozuwa, who recently dumped the Peoples Democratic Party for the APC, commended Governor Obaseki’s developmental strides since assumption of office and urged the people to be patient with the
governor. “Governor Obaseki is working; look at the roads, infrastructure, and economic policies. But Edo people must make sacrifice. Governor Obaseki is using the state’s resources to empower the people. Other governors should emulate him,” he urged. On his part, the Edo State Secretary, APC, Mr. Lawrence Okah, described the lawmaker as a good ambassador, adding that the party had no option but to reciprocate the gesture at the appropriate time. “APC is not a party that is greedy; we know what to do at the appropriate time,” he promised. Also, a former Majority Leader, Edo State House of Assembly, Hon. Matthew Iduoreyekemwen, who also lauded the lawmaker’s gesture,  said the tricycles should be seen as seeds that must be nurtured, to yield greater output to further reduce poverty in
the state.
