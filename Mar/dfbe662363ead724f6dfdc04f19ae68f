The Nigeria Immigration Service, has suspended two officers, Araoyinbo Oluwadare and Gabriel Awosanmi, for allegedly aiding and abetting human trafficking. The suspension was announced in a statement on Friday by the spokesman of the agency, Mr Sunday James. Recall that, Oluwadare, a Senior Inspector of Immigration, and Awosanmi, an Immigration Assistant 1, were arrested at the Lagos international airport on Thursday night. The officers allegedly facilitated an attempted trafficking of six underage girls to Oman and Kuwait through an Ethiopian Airlines flight. The duo were reportedly apprehended by the aviation security personnel at the airport. However, James said, “The Comptroller General of Immigration, Muhammad Babandede, has ordered the suspension of the above mentioned from duties with immediate effect in line with Service Rules and Regulations. “The suspension is to allow for detailed investigation into the issue with a view to unraveling their level of culpability and indeed other syndicates involved in the act. “The comptroller-general therefore assures the public of management’s commitment to the eradication of smuggling of migrants and trafficking of persons in the country.’’
