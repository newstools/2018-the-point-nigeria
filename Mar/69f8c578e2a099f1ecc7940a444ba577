The value of capital imported into Nigeria rose by 29.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year to $5.32 billion, as economic activities return on the growth trajectory. The National Bureau of Statistics made the disclosure on Friday, even as it said capital imports stood at $12.2 billion for 2017, up from $5.38 billion that they were, in the previous year. NBS report said Nigeria’s economy climbed 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter to return to growth as oil revenues rose. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been injecting dollars into the forex market to support the naira and the economy. The Bureau explained that capital imports were over $4 billion in the third quarter, the first such quarterly rise since 2015. The rise was driven by portfolio and other investments, adding that portfolio investment accounted for the largest amount of capital imported in Q4 2017, driven by strong growth in money market instruments. Yields on treasury bills have traded as high as 18 per cent in the past. But the government has been working to lower its borrowing cost by repaying matured bills rather than rolling them over as it has done in the past. Bills now trade at rates of around 13 per cent. Meanwhile, experts have expressed satisfaction with 0.82 per cent Gross Domestic Product growth rate recorded in 2017 and 1.92 per cent in the fourth quarter of the year, describing it as a clear evidence that Nigeria’s quick win policies to revive the economy are working. They said the CBN’s anchor’s borrowers scheme had led to increased activities in the agricultural sector, just as the Bank of Industry has intensified funding to businesses, and all these interventions aided growth in GDP. Government spending also increased at a 2.9 per cent rate, adding 0.49 point to growth.
