Chairman of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Mohammadu Nuru Abdullah has spoken the fresh attack on his members in Plateau State. Abdullah, in a statement, described the Monday night attack which left herdsmen dead as an act of terror. “We are overwhelmingly shocked that the Irigwe militias, in an effort to accomplish their mission of terrorising Fulani herdsmen in Bassa Local Government Area in Plateau State, had on Monday re-launched an attack on Fulani cattle herders and mercilessly killed three persons, namely, Abubakar Shehu, Abubakar Gidado and Ishaq Yusuf without any provocation. “It is also disturbing that the Irigwe community always trespasses into other neighboring local government areas, launch their attacks and kill our people for no cause.” Abdullah added that on the same Monday when three of his kinsmen were killed, the same militias attacked and killed 38 cows, saying 20 of the cows belonged to Wada Alh Audu, while 18 belonged to Umaru Ibrahim. “The Irigwe militias usually cross into Riyom, Jos South and part of southern Kaduna to strike. In this particular incident, they operated from Rukwechungu village of Miango district in Bassa LGA into Gero village of Gyel district in Jos South LGA. “They also beat up and wounded Haruna Zakariya, who is now receiving treatment at a clinic in Rafin Bauna. It is on record that this militia group has been unleashing terror against our innocent cattle headers in the areas. “It is unfortunate that while efforts are being made to restore peace and order, the silent killings of Fulani herdsmen by Irigwe militia continue unabated,” he said. Abdullah, however, thanked the state government and the security agencies in Plateau State for restoring order. He also advised community leaders in the area to work out modalities to compliment the efforts of the state government and the security agencies.
