Manchester United striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, will pocket an eye-watering £2million, if they win the Champions League this season. Ibrahimovic has only played 16 minutes in the competition and not featured at all since he picked up a knee injury on Boxing Day against Burnley. However, he took a massive pay cut on his previous £365,000-per-week deal, when he resigned for Jose Mourinho’s side back in August last year. Ibrahimovic earns £180,000 a week now, but his bonus structure seems to be one of the most lucrative in football. According to The Sun, “Zlatan took a massive hit on his basic pay last time but the club have always been straight with him. “They know it is his dream to finally win the Champions League and that this season was likely to be his last shot. “The bonuses are big for all the squad but Ibra had a number on extra personal incentives included.” United host Sevilla next week having come away with a 0-0 draw in Spain, as they look to progress to the quarter-finals.
