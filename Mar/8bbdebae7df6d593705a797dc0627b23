The gross earnings of Zenith Bank Plc has increased from N689.6 billion as at 2016 to N745.2 billion by the 2017 financial year end, an increase of 46.7 per
cent. Its after-tax earnings also rose by 37.2 per cent, from N157.9 billion to N177.9 billion, which outperformed analysts’ consensus estimate of N159.52
billion. The bank’s fourth quarter revenue came in surprisingly stronger than anticipated as non-interest revenue doubled, rising by 97 per cent, quarter-on-quarter, to N101.1 billion.  Zenith Bank’s interest income also advanced by 13.4 per cent despite the moderation in interest rate levels during the period. Overall, the bank reported a total of N158.04 billion in trading gains in FY’17 (+21.2 per cent of total revenue) compared to N28.4 billion (+5.8 per cent of total revenue) in FY’16. An analyst with Cordos Capital Limited said, “We believe the huge trading gains reported in Q4’17 was most likely as a result of mark-to-market gains on its Treasury bill portfolio, which reflected the capital gains impact of the declining interest rate
environment. “While we await further clarity on what drove impairments from management, we suspect that the bank made full provisions for its Etisalat exposure – an estimated balance of N50 billion.” However, the operating expenses were 29.99 per cent higher than the previous year’s at N226.86 billion, and 3.50 per cent higher than the Cordros Capital estimate of N219.20
billion. Other highlights of the result showed that interest income was up by 23.42 per cent to N474.63 billion, from 240.2 billion.
