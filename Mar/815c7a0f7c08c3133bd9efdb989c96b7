The Chairman of the Edo State chapter of Grassroots Democratic Party of Nigeria, Pastor Osarumwense Oshodin, has said that some political top shots, who include a leading presidential aspirant in the Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, are jostling for the party’s tickets to contest in the 2019 general elections, both at the state and national levels. Oshodin said this on the occasion of the inauguration of the party’s state secretariat in Benin-City, recently. He disclosed that some were showing interest to fly the party’s flag for the Edo State House of Assembly while there were those jostling for the House of Representatives, Senate and the Presidency tickets. “They are many as they keep coming to pick up our tickets; which means that there is something unique in our party,” he enthused. The party chairman said the mission of the party was to help the down-trodden, better the lives of Nigerians and give “those who the so-called leaders have cast away, a sense of belonging.” He also said the party’s manifesto stood for transformation and solution to corruption prevalent in the country. The party boss, who observed that the level of insecurity in the country was alarming, said that the party would provide solution to all these problems, if it comes into power.
