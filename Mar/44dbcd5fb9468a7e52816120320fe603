Newly inaugurated Board Member of the National Horticultural Research Institute, Ibadan, Oyo State, Alhaja Kafilat Ogbara, has pledged to champion the cause of a greener environment through massive flower and tree planting across the country. Ogbara, who spoke shortly after chairmen and members of boards for parastatals and agencies were inaugurated by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, assured that she would work in concert with other board members in ensuring that the Nigerian environment is protected against pollution. “All over the world, the emphasis is on making the environment congenial through the greens, and we cannot afford to be left behind. “To save the society from the damaging effects of gas flaring and other gaseous effluents that constitute the world, we have to intensify efforts in planting flowers, trees and other plants of environmental value. “Alread,y some societies have started using ethanol to derive energy, thus advancing the cause of the environment, which is needed for good living and longevity,” she said. Ogbara, an All Progressives Congress chieftain in Lagos, commended the vigour with which Governor Akinwumi Ambode had been working to make Lagos a beautiful place. “In Lagos State, every day is the dawn of a new thing and this has now become the norm for the Ambode administration.” She particularly commended the various road and canal chanelisation projects embarked upon by the governor, saying, “Ambode has indeed affirmed Lagos as a model state in the country, from which others can copy.”
