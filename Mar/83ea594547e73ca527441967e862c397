There were conflicting views between members of the Kogi State House of Assembly on Wednesday over a motion to pass a vote of confidence on Governor Yahaya Bello. The motion which was sponsored by Honourable Bello Hassan Abdullahi (APC Ajaokuta) generated heated debates among members who were for or against. Bello in his motion intimated the House that the Governor had performed excellently well in his two years in office. According to the APC lawmaker, kudos should be given to the Governor on areas of security, infrastructural development, improved health service, educational development and economic growth of the state. He prayed that a letter of commendation should be written and delivered to the governor for a job well done in the state, urging him to continue his good work undeterred by detractors or obstacles. Supported by the Deputy Speaker Hassan Abdullahi ( APC Okura State Constituency), the immediate past Speaker of the House Umar Ahmed Imam (APC Lokoja 1) had a contrary views with the mover of the motion. The former speaker said although he wasn’t against the motion, its should it shouldn’t have come as a motion of urgent public importance. Imam further explained that, passing a vote of confidence on the governor was not ripe yet. Supporting his claim, Barrister Oluwatoyin Lawal (PDP Yagba West) drew the attention of members to house rule Nos 44. Other members such as Ahmed Mohammed (APC Ankpa 1), Abdulkareem Kekere (APC Okehi), Idris Ndakwo (APC Lokoja 2), Victor Omofaiye ( APC Ijumu), John Abba (APC Ibaji) Moses Ododo ( APC Okura ) in their various contributions supported the motion, stressing that it will encourage the Governor to do more for the State.
