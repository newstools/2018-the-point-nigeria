She is one of the hottest actresses in Nollywood and also runs a clothing line called Fancy Collections. Having grown big in the industry, she is now one of the most talked about. Chika Ike is more than just an actress. She is a United Nations peace ambassador, a multiple award winner and a two-time Africa Movie Academy Award nominee. She graduated from the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles, California, USA. She has been applauded for her philanthropic work in the society; she established a foundation, Help the Child, to uplift the less privileged.   But Chika is also fashionable and elegant. For her, “fashion and sophisticated dressing is all about knowing the key elements and combining them properly.” She says, “Personal style is something that each of us has; we just have to identify it, understand it, and then live it. It projects your mood, personality and you as a whole, reflecting your personal interests, lifestyle, inspirations and your past. “I like to look great in whatever I wear. When you find your personal style, you look great and feel confident when you leave your home. Whether you prefer Bohemian, street, high fashion, minimal or classic, you can make your style look classy when the occasion calls for it.” Chika also notes that fashion is evolving and “you cannot be a celebrity without being knowledgeable about fashion. You must be conscious of what you wear and what is trending in the fashion world. Being fashionable is a gift.” Speaking on her beauty secrets, she expresses love for make-up and all other fashion accessories. “Choosing the right fashion accessories is very important when shopping. Accessorising is what actually gives an outfit a personal touch. The way you accessorise is an important part of your style. Most garments in your colour are probably (and should be) in neutral colors; so you can combine them, when you find it suitable,” she says.
