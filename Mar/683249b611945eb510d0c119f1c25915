Sensational juju musician, Yomi Peters, who is the creator of the Juju Shuffle genre, and co-creator of Shina Peters’ Afro Juju sound, has said Jesus Christ will return to the world through Nigeria Yomi, who spoke with our correspondent, insisted that he stood by his
words. He said that Nigeria’s problems, from the onset, were all due to the fact that the country was destined to be very great, adding that it must go through tribulations to achieve greatness. According to him, “Nigeria is so great that even our Lord Jesus Christ has chosen it as the country through which He will return to the world; so, the devil is not happy about this and is trying all his possible best to destroy the country in order to ambush Jesus’ plan.” Still speaking on Nigeria’s greatness, he said the country had been ordained as the second greatest country in the world after America “and if not for the devil’s interference, that’s the way it should have been right now.” He insisted that Nigeria was destined to be greater than Europe and Asia and positioned to displace America as the world’s greatest country. Peters, therefore, advised Nigerians not to lose faith in the country because the future was extremely bright, adding that if he didn’t believe in Nigeria, he wouldn’t have returned home after spending ten years in America.
