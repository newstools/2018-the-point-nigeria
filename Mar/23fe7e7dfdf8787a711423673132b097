Towering defender, Ike ThankGod, is yet to come to terms with the reality of the death of former Enyimba captain and Kano Pillars centre back, Chinedu Udoji. ThankGod who partnered Udoji in the Enyimba back line recalled his perfect understanding with Udoji while their careers at Enyimba lasted. “I still find it difficult to believe Chinedu Udoji is dead,” ThankGod who later played for Sunshine Stars after spells at Warrior Wolves and FC Fanja of Oman said. “That Udoji is dead, just like that? Its a piece cake difficult to swallow,” he began with a tinge of regret. “I remember when we were together at Enyimba, that was in 2016. “We were always seen as giants in Enyimba defence. He covered me well each time I move up-field, especially during corner kick or free kick situations. “And I equally do so each time he overlapped. You could see the understanding between us. “That year, 2016, we defeated Kano Pillars 2-1 right there in Kano, a result that would never have been predicted. “Yes, I scored the winning goal but if I can posthumously dedicate the goal to Chinedu Udoji. “He was gentle, humble, full of humour and passionate. We will miss him greatly. “How sad it is that two seasons after, Udoji died in same Kano”. The 2009 CAF Champions League semi finalist recalled that the last match he played alongside the deceased, was a Federation Cup semi-final game against Nasarawa United in Ibadan which they lost 0-1.
