The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board on Tuesday directed candidates who have written the 2018 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations to visit the board’s website for their results. JAMB Head of Media, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, gave the directive at a news conference at the board’s headquarters in Bwari, Abuja. Benjamin said that the results had been scrutinised and released on its website, www.jamb.org.ng, adding that candidates were now free to visit JAMB website for their results. He also explained that the results would be released in batches to enable candidates who have already taken the examination to check them. The JAMB Registrar, Prof. Is’haq Oloyede, recently said that unlike the 2017 exercise, the Board would not release the results of the 2018 examinations immediately until after two or three days. This, he stated, was not because the Board was incapable of releasing them immediately but that results must undergo review and total scrutiny to avoid multiple cancellation of candidates’ results. The 2018 UTME began on Friday and is scheduled to finish on Saturday.
