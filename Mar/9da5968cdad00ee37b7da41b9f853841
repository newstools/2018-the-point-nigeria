The Chief Executive Officer, Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, Mr. Yinka Sanni, noted that the strong performance was an evidence of the positive outcome of the group’s strategy of growing the client base across the target and key market segments, while maintaining a principled credit process. “The Group reported its best profitability results since inception. We achieved a 70 per cent growth in profit after tax amid healthy capital and liquidity levels. Our balance sheet grew by 32 per cent to N1.39 trillion and this was funded mainly by customer deposit growth of 34 per cent,” Sanni stated. He noted that the various business divisions achieved strong operating results as well as retained market leadership across the various businesses such as global markets, investment banking, pension, stockbroking, asset management, and custodial services, with several accolades received during the year. “Furthermore, Fitch retained our AAA national ratings, which reaffirms our strong fundamentals, stability, creditworthiness and low relative risk in the Nigerian financial markets,” he added. Moving forward, Sanni said the Group remained optimistic that it would sustain the improved financial performance in 2018 and
beyond. “While we are encouraged by the impressive results, we remain focused on improving risk asset quality, managing our cost base, maintaining our capital strength and increasing our returns to shareholders. We are positive that the Group will benefit from a more stable macroeconomic environment, to drive growth in lending and other business activities,”
he stated.
