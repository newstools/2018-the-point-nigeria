If there’s one person that can’t stop being in the news, it’s Tiwa Savage, who’s currently widely regarded as Nigeria’s most successful contemporary female musician. The latest news about her is that she has filed for divorce from her husband and ex-manager, Tunji Balogun. The news is a shock to her fans as they didn’t see it coming after Tiwa and Balogun were believed to have made up after their marital spat, which was in the public domain a couple of years ago. Now that she’s reported to have filed for divorce, additional reports say Balogun returned to America since late last year and Savage, too, is finally ready to move on, hence the need for a divorce that will make her legally free. Though her fans and well-wishers have been hard hit by the news, she doesn’t seem to be having any blues over it and is even waxing stronger in her entertainment career.
