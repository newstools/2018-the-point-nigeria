American Super model, Naomi Campbell has revealed that she was at the launch of the Eko Atlantic at the request of President Muhammadu Buhari. Campbell shared several photos of her at the event with Buhari and wrote on her Twitter page: “Was a pleasure to be invited by His Excellency The President of The Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari to the private launch of Eko Atlantic. ♥️ @NGRPresident @MBuhari.” However, in a swift response, the Personal Assistant to Buhari on New Media, Bashir Ahmaad, insisted that Campbell “bumped” into her principal and requested to take pictures. “For the sake of clarity, President @MBuhari didn’t invite Ms. Naomi Campbell to any event during his 2-day visit to Lagos State. They only met at the Eko Atlantic City while Mr. President was touring the project, and she requested to take photos with him,” Ahmaad tweeted. Buhari is in Lagos on a two-day visit, during which he attended the 66th birthday dinner for the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu and launched several projects around the state.
