The All Progressives Congress has said that the party’s national working committee led by its chairman, John Odigie-Oyegun’s tenure extension still stands despite President Muhammadu Buhari’s rejection earlier today. Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi disclosed this while in a chat with journalists in Abuja on Tuesday. According to him, President Buhari only expressed a personal opinion which cannot be considered the decision of the National Executive Council (NEC) which approved the extension in the first place. He insisted that the decision still stands until the NEC reverses itself. “The president’s position has not changed the position of NEC. NEC has not reversed itself on the tenure extension. The decision of the NEC on the one-year tenure extension still stands. “The president is not NEC. The NEC will have to reverse itself but right now, it has not done that. So, the tenure extension still stands,” Abdullahi said.
