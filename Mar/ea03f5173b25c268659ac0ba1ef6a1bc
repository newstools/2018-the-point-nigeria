The Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, said the President Muhammadu Buhari led administration has spent over N2.5 trillion on infrastructure, especially special projects, between 2015 and 2016. Adeosun, who disclosed this at the fourth Ogun State Investors’ Forum, in Abeokuta, Ogun State, said, “If we had gone for the first option of cutting down on our costs during recession, it means we would have laid off workers. But we chose to stimulate the economy with massive investments in roads, power, rails and other infrastructure as part of deliberate efforts to grow the economy.
