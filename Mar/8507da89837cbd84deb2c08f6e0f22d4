Sadly, in the Nigerian music industry, competition winners have not really stood out as expected. From Project Fame West Africa to Nigerian Idol to X-Factor to West African Idol, the winners of the competition have only minimally done well.
Only Iyanya and Chidinma have done well as PF winners. Timi Dakolo has also tried as WAI winner, but all other winners are really nowhere to be found.
But one winner, from NI, who is trying to break the jinx of NIwinners never having done well, is Evelle.
She has released some singles since her 2014 win, but none of them has become a major hit. Sheâ€™s, however, back with another single, Na Work, and is already promoting it.
Good luck, girl.
