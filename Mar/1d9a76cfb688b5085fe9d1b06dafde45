A former deputy senate president, Ibrahim Mantu has opened up to Nigerians that he helped his party the Peoples Democratic Party rig elections in the past. The former Deputy Senate President said this when he was being interviewed by Maupe Ogun-Yusuf of Channels Television. He said he bribed officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission as well as security agents in the past. The presenter had asked him to confirm his earlier comments hinting that he helped rig elections, to which he replied: “Let me tell you one thing, yes I did. I am now confessing the truth.” “What do I need? I don’t have to go and change election… but you know, when you provide money; you give money to INEC boys to help you, if they see any chance, that they should favour you. You (also) provide money to the security.
