The Lagos State Government has partnered the World Health Organisation to give free vaccination to children between nine months and five years across the healthcare centres in the state. The Medical Director, Alimosho General Hospital, Igando, Dr. Adebajo Madewa, said the partnership would further increase the fight against the infection across the country with the adoption of international best medical practices. Madewa, who spoke at the opening of the seven-day immunisation programme at the hospital, noted that the government was determined to totally rid the state of measles by 2020, a statement said on Tuesday. “Adverse Effect Following Immunisation (AEFI) team is on the ground to help victims of adverse reactions that might arise in the course of carrying out the immunisation exercise,” he added. A consultant paediatrician at the general hospital, Dr. Oyejoke Oyefesobi, identified symptoms of measles to include fever above 40°C, cough, a runny nose and inflamed eyes with small white spots known as Koplik’s Spotmay inside the mouth. He said, “In developing countries where measles is endemic, WHO doctors recommend that two doses of vaccines be given at six and nine months of age. This move is targeted at curtailing the viral contagious disease possibly to zero level.” A senior matron, Sanni Olamide of the Child Welfare Clinic of the facility, said malnourished children were mostly affected by measles, adding that it was aggravated by dirty environment.
