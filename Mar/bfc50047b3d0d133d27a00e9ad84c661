The Lagos State Police Command has paraded no fewer than 255 suspects arrested at separate raids at Akala-Mushin and Idi-Oro areas of Lagos State. In a statement made available to our correspondent, the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Chike Oti, said raid on the areas became necessary in order to contain criminal activities in the communities. Oti, who noted that the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Edgal Imohimi, ordered that the areas should be cleared of criminal activities, said the police were resisted by the miscreants. He said the suspects vandalised some of their patrol vans where they were parked as the officers were carrying out the raids. “The CP, Mr. Edgal Omohimi, ordered a raid of identified criminal enclaves in Akala-Mushin and Idi-Oro.  During the raid, these criminal elements resisted the police by vandalising some vehicles parked on the roadsides. “The raid of criminal hideouts in these areas became pertinent because of  the brazen nature criminals living among the people  attack residents and law enforcement officers with impunity. “This did not deter the police  from arresting 255 suspects comprising of 246 males and 9 females, seizing 39 big bags of weeds suspected to be Indian hemp and recovering of two pump action rifles and  ammunition in the process. “The Commissioner of Police vowed that the Command will not rest until drug peddlers, cultists and armed criminals are rid  from the streets of Lagos. “The Command hereby advises parents, guardians and stakeholders to warn their children and wards to stay off criminal  enclaves and avoid mingling with criminals. The CP added that the raid will continue in all places identified by police intelligence unit as blackspots,” Oti said. He said investigation into the case is concluded and all the arrested suspects have been charged to court  with the  collaboration of the Directorate of Public  Prosecution, DPP.
