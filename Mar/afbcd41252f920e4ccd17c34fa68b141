Manchester United’s  board have told Paul Pogba and his teammates that they must cooperate with manager, Jose Mourinho, or face being kicked out of the club. There have been talks of a discord between the manager and United’s record signing, Pogba. A dip in form saw Pogba dropped from the team for Premier League and Champions League fixtures and the Frenchman was said to be unhappy with his role under the former Chelsea boss. A source at Old Trafford told The Independent, UK, that it was made clear to Pogba and his representatives that the club would back Mourinho in any future fall-out. The report says that Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is said to fully support Mourinho’s approach and is ready to allow players to leave if the situation becomes irreconcilable with the manager. Woodward said United will continue to progress under Mourinho, after the club won two trophies in his first season at the club. Manchester United have improved reasonably well this season, taking 62 points from 29 games, although they remain well adrift of rivals Manchester City at the top of the league. The Red Devils also topped their Champions League group and can qualify for the quarter-finals if they beat visiting Sevilla at Trafford in the second leg of their last-16 clash next week.
