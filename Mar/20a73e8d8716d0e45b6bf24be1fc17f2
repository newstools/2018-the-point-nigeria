Former vice president Namadi Sambo was summoned to brief President Muhammadu Buhari on some issues related to power and transport sectors. A source said on Tuesday night ​that ​Sambo was at the Presidential Villa at the instance of the President, against speculations that he sought audience to see the President. According to him, “Sambo was the chairman of the National Council on Privatisation, alternate chairman of Presidential Action Committee on Power. “He also coordinated a number of committees related to power sector reform and transportation. You may recall that Namadi Sambo had briefed Osinbajo on similar issues last year. “President Buhari is keen on attaining the 10,000mw target in the next three years, and he wanted to take some key decisions in the power and transport sector. “The President also takes the issue of rail transport seriously. Since he is not derailing from the previous administration’s roadmap, he sought to hear from Namadi Sambo before taking the decisions.”
