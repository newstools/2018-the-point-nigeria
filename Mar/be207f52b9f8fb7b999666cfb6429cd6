Malam Nasir El-Rufai the governor of Kaduna State has asked Fulani leaders in the state to uphold peace and ensure that their children are educated. He said this at a meeting with Fulani ardos from the 32 emirates and chiefdoms in the state. He urged them to do their utmost to uphold peace in the state. Addressing the meeting, which was also attended by the officials of the Kaduna State Peace Commission, led by Ms. Priscilla Ankut, the executive vice-chairman, the governor said that the purpose was to discuss how to deepen peace in the state. “We called this meeting because we need to deepen peace in our state. Peace is important and it is something we cannot compromise. “We will continue to work assiduously for the security and peace of our communities. “Everyone must reject violence because it is a destructive tool that tears communities apart and retards all human development. “Sound education is the foundation for purposeful development. There is no society that will progress without education. “With sound education, we can train people to reject hate, shun criminality, overcome poverty and promote harmony. “We will continue to work towards building sound education and health sectors as bedrocks of development,” El-Rufai explained. He, however, urged the ardos to be prompt in providing useful security information to the appropriate agencies, and to educate their followers on peaceful conflict resolution. In her remarks, Ankut said that the focus of the commission was to work towards amicable resolution of conflict in the state by way of mediation and consultative engagements. Ankut appealed for the cooperation of the ardos as the commission continues its engagements with traditional, religious and community leaders for sustainable peace.
