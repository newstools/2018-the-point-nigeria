Everton winger Korede Adedoyin enjoyed one of his proudest moments since he started playing the round leather game after scoring four goals for the Toffees in their 7-0 demolition of Newcastle United in the Under-18 Premier League at the weekend. The Nigerian-born teenager scored from close range in the 28th minute to give the home team a three-goal advantage. Meanwhile, sources at the Nigerian Football Federation informed The Point, that young Korede is already on the NFF radar, as he is bound to be invited home soon, to feature in the junior national team. “We’ve reached out to his handlers in Everton, while the next leg is to discuss with him and his parents; but rest assured, the boy is coming home,” an NFF source, who craved anonymity, said, Adedoyin netted the second of his four goals a minute into the second half and got his hat-trick in the 66th minute, then completed his double brace with a stunning curler after beating three Newcastle United defenders. Everton Under-18s coach, Paul Tait, was full of praise for Adedoyin, and believes the player’s hard work paid off. He told Everton’s official website : ‘’We played him in a different position today to try to get him on the ball and he’s done fantastic. ‘’His work rate was excellent today and he got his reward with four goals. Hopefully that will make him see the benefit of working hard.’’ Korede, who has cited Ivory Coast international, Wilfried Zaha, as his role model, has been on the books of Everton since the age of 10, and rose through the ranks before making his debut for the U-18s during the 2016-17 season.
