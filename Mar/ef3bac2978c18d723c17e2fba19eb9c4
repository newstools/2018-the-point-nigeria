Democratic Republic of Congo striker, Cedric Bakambu, has become the most expensive African footballer, following his £65million move to Chinese Super League club, Beijing Guoan, from Villarreal. The transfer beat the £56m Arsenal paid Borussia Dortmund for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang last January. Although Beijing Gouan met Bakambu’s release clause weeks ago, the deal has only just been completed after they were forced to pay a super tax to Chinese authorities. Rules state that clubs must pay 100% tax on new signings, but Beijing Guoan managed to negotiate a discount which saved them £5m. They had argued that meeting Bakambu’s release clause technically made him a free agent and therefore no tax payment was required. Bakambu scored 46 times in 101 appearances for Villarreal and was LaLiga Player of the Month for October 2017.
