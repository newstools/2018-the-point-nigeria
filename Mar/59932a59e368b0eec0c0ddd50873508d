The Women’s World Banking report has revealed that most of the Nigerian women running businesses in the bustling urban markets save their daily income in informal savings tools and not banks. A Director, Competitive Strategies, Financial Sector Deepening Africa, WWB, Mr. Paul Musoke, said, “Women running businesses in the bustling urban markets of Lagos put aside as much as 60 per cent of their daily income in informal savings tools such as ajo, adako and others. “The most surprising thing was that these women’s businesses were located close to bank branches. Why were they not opening savings accounts?” According to him, Nigerian banks should close the gap by offering an innovative and relevant savings product that crosses the barriers preventing low-income Nigerians from accessing formal financial services. “The distance is emotional, not physical. These market women are familiar with banks, yet they do not see them as relevant or accessible. Even those who have accounts usually place most of their money in traditional, though more informal, financial tools,” he added. Manager, Strategic Advisory, WWB, Mr. Ryan Newton, stressed that such innovation would enable the youth to build financial capability that would serve as a foundation for banking successfully, as adults. He said, “By using a ‘gamified platform’, they will help young clients build their financial capabilities and set them up for long-term success. Offering incentives like points, badges and rewards for positive financial behaviours would boost setting savings goals, and achieving those goals.”
