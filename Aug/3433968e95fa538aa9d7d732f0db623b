 …says facility belongs to all Nigerians President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has condemned the last minute cancellation of the approval granted to Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, to utilize the Eagle Square in Abuja for his 2019 presidential declaration. Saraki in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in Abuja, stated that the “Eagle Square belongs to all Nigerians,” stressing that the cancellation of the earlier approval granted Kwankwaso by the Federal Capital Territory Administration had sent a wrong message about the tolerance level in the nation’s politics. According to the Senate president, “The refusal to allow Senator Kwankwaso to utilize the Eagle Square for his Presidential declaration, despite an earlier approval, sends a wrong message about our democracy, particularly the tolerance level in our politics. “That square belongs to all Nigerians because it was built with public funds. We hope this is not what we will be seeing as we approach the 2019 general elections.”
