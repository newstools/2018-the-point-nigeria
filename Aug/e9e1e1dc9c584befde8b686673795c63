Chelsea central defender Kenneth Omeruo is set to become the second most expensive Nigerian defender in history, if Club Deportivo Leganés activate their option to buy him on a permanent basis next summer. The reliable Chelsea Youth has tweeted that the option to buy Omeruo is set at €7 million, not €5 million, contrary to earlier reports. The 24-year-old has been loaned out to CD Leganés until June 30, next year and this is the fifth club he has been loaned out to since his arrival at Chelsea from Sunshine Stars in January 2012. Taribo West’s move to Inter Milan in June 1997 cost the Italian club €12 million and he is the most expensive Nigerian defender in history till date, followed by Joseph Enakarhire and Joseph Yobo, who cost Dinamo Moscow and Everton €6 million each, respectively. The fourth most expensive Nigerian defender is Onyekachi Apam, who joined Rennes from OGC Nice for a fee of 4 million euros, with 20 per cent of the transfer fee paid to his former club, Enugu Rangers. In other defensive positions, the costliest Nigerian left-back in history is Celestine Babayaro, who joined Chelsea for 3.5 million euros, while AS Roma’s Nura Abdullahi is the most expensive right-back at €2.5 million.
