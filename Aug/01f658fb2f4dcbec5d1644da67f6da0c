Senator Godswill Akpabio, former Minority Leader of the Senate, has addressed reports of a perceived rift between him and Udom Emmanuel, Governor of Akwa Ibom State. Recall that Akpabio had appointed Udom as the Secretary to the State Government in 2013. He is also believed to have supported Udom to succeed him as Governor. Following the defection, there were claims that he left PDP for APC because of issues between him and Emmanuel. However, speaking to Channels Television, Akpabio denied the claim, saying that there was no face-off between them. He said, “No, no, no. I don’t have any issue with the current Governor of Akwa Ibom State, His Excellency Udom Gabriel Emmanuel. He remains my Governor, and a godfather to my children. I don’t have any issue with him. “If there are local issues, these are things we can sit down on the table and resolve. And, for me, I think of the national interest. ”I believe strongly that with the challenges we’re having now, all hands should be on deck.”
