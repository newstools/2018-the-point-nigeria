The Nigeria Labour Congress has asked the Governor Abiola Ajimobi-led Oyo State Government to immediately compensate ace musician, Yinka Ayefele, for demolishing his Music House last week. In a statement by its President, Mr. Ayuba Wabba, the NLC called on the state government to tender an unreserved apology to the musician. The statement read in part, “It is a shame that the government is killing this dream in a state with a reputation for individual industry and commerce. “In light of the foregoing, we call on the government to tender an unreserved apology to Mr Yinka Ayefele, compensate him for his losses as well as promise to be of good behaviour to its citizens.” Describing the demolition as malicious and ill-advised, the union wondered why the state government went ahead to demolish the building despite a subsisting court order. The NLC said it is unfortunate that at a time when most state governments cannot pay salaries, the government could go ahead to destroy a business which is providing employment and creating wealth for its people. The union advised Ajimobi to change his arrogant style of leadership. It added, “This level of impunity is not acceptable to us and cannot be tolerated in any civilised society. We believe the government acted maliciously and with clear intent to cause grievous injury and hurt, the motive of which it has yet to make public. “Smarting from the round condemnation of the state’s criminal conduct, the Governor, Abiola Ajimobi, in a remorseless outburst gloated that curses placed on him in respect of this matter would not affect him. “We consider this as another level of impunity and pettiness unbecoming of a governor and a clear demonstration of lack of capacity to manage public outrage. He should bury his head in shame. “We hope and pray Governor Ajimobi experiences a rebirth, rediscovers his humanity as well as reconnects with his people in service and humility instead of opening a new war front every other day!”
