Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara and his Deputy, Yusuf Lasun, were absent at the 6th National Executive Council, NEC, meeting of the All Progressives Congress, currently going on at the party’s secretariat in Abuja. National Chairman of the ruling party, Adams Oshiomhole, informed the NEC members that Dogara and Lasun sent in letters apologising for their inability to make it to the meeting. Before the meeting went into a closed-door session, Oshiomhole stated that Senator Ahmed Lawan, who is the Senate Majority Leader, will act as the Senate President. Senate President Bukola Saraki had weeks ago defected from the APC to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. He stated this while observing protocols, saying, “Senate President, well in the absence of the Senate President, the Senate Leader, Senator Ahmed Lawan can stand in.” The former Labour leader also gave account of his stewardship in the last two months in office. He said under his leadership, the party recorded victories at the Ekiti gubernatorial election, including the bye-elections that took place in Bauchi and Katsina. Oshiomhole however appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to show more commitment in addressing genuine grievances that may have spurred some members of the party to defect.
