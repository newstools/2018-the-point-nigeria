A governorship aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party in Lagos State, Engr. Deji Doherty, has said that the party would defeat the All Progressives Congress, and its candidate, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode in 2019. He said this was because his party has the strategy and qualified people that would meet the yearnings and aspirations of Lagosians and provide dividends of democracy. Doherty, who spoke with Independent, said the PDP would win the Lagos State governorship elections because Lagosians were already tired of the government of the APC which had failed them in spite of the fact that the State made so much in terms of Internally Generated Revenue and Federal Allocations. He said, “It is strategy and not noise making that will make an aspirant win an election, commitment to the people and to God. Our strategy is good and we are committed up to the polling booths. We are going to rely on our votes. “We are going to also rely on the dissatisfaction that Lagosians have from this APC government. I think that is what is going to propel us towards winning the election. “The non-indigenes, the Ijaws, the Igbo, the Hausa and the Fulani people are all aware of what they are not getting. “The youth, the women, the low-income earners, the physically-challenged are aware that they have been deprived of certain things in a state where the internally generated revenue and the money they get from federation account is close to N50 billion on a monthly basis. “We are actually looking at a government that has promised so much and has just done little and that is why we are very hopeful that when we come on board in 2019 we would change the narrative of governance in Lagos State,” he said.
