   Kalu Eziyi, Umuahia  The Director, Field Operations, 2015 All Progressive Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign, Chief Ikechi Emenike has insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari has reduced corruption in the country. Emenike stated this while speaking to our Correspondent after addressing several party stakeholders at both Item and Nkpa in Bende Local Government Area. “Going by the consistency and the successes Buhari has recorded, it is certain that by the end of his second term in 2023, the country will be free from many ills,” he argued. The Abia State leader of the party maintained that if the campaign was sustained, it would release resources for the pursuit of developmental programmes and projects in the country. He noted that though Buhari’s critics had been saying the campaign had been biased against his perceived political opponents, they have at least recognized that something is being done about it. While inaugurating the leaderships of Emenike Daughters, Emenike Teenagers, and party’s stakeholders in the area, he said, “I agree with him that if we do not kill corruption now, it will kill the country later.” Emenike, who was also the deputy chairman of both Buhari Campaign Board, and Buhari Presidential Primary Election Team, predicted that the party would sweep the poll in the state in the 2019 general election.  Also speaking, the state chairman of the party, Dr. Emmanuel Ndukwe reiterated the support and commitment of members to ensuring its total victory in the election. He appealed to the youth, who he said would benefit most from an APC government in both the state and the country, to ensure they registered for and obtained their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). Similarly, Mrs Ucheoma Offonri said women are the most concerned about the welfare of the people, assuring of their resolve to support the party for change in the state.
