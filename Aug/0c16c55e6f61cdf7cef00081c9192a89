Atiku Abubakar, former Vice President, has said Nigerians should not vote for the ruling All Progressives Congress because “they have ruined the country’s economy”. The Waziri of Adamawa said this while addressing journalists at the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, secretariat in Minna, Niger State on Thursday. Abubakar, a presidential candidate of the PDP, said the APC-led government has remained consistently insensitive to Nigeria’s diversity, hence can’t make it better. He noted that the level of insecurity experienced currently was more than the civil war the country had. According to Abubakar, “APC has failed Nigerians and I don’t think there is need to give them a second chance. “It is very clear that as far as economic growth is concerned, the APC government has failed and that is why we have the highest number of joblessness, highest poverty rate. “As you all know, we have been described as the capital of poverty in the whole world, and that has led us to the greatest challenge of insecurity that we are faced in this country. “Even during the civil war, we did not experience this type of challenge. “Coupled with that, the government has remained consistently insensitive to our diversity and, therefore, the patronage in the government is given to only one part of the country.”
