The incident occurred when the minor spent the N50 given to her by Mama Daniel’s grandmother to buy some biscuit when he was hungry. David told the police that Mama Daniel put a knife in fire and used it to inflict injuries on him.    The Coordinator of Child Protection Network in the Shomolu area, Comrade Toyin Okanlawon, said the 9-year -old boy had also been suffering from malnutrition due to his guardian’s alleged lack of care for him. After sustaining the injuries, the minor, who lives with suspect at St Finbarr's  College Road, Bariga, Lagos, was rushed to the Shomolu General Hospital for
treatment. Okanlawon said the case was reported at the Bariga Police Station before it was later transferred to the Gender Section of the force. The boy was said to have pleaded with the police not to allow him return to his guardian’s home as he was likely to suffer more torture in her hands. The minor accused his guardian of starving him of food and beating him always. When asked about his mother, the minor could not say anything regarding her whereabouts.
