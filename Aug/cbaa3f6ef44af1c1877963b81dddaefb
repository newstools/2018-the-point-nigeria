All roads led to ACME area of Ogba in Lagos on Tuesday causing traffic gridlock  where the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, said that he was confident President Muhammadu Buhari would win the 2019 elections, He condemned the unconstructive criticism of the present administration saying that President Buhari has done well despite all challenges. “Our president, President Muhammadu Buhari has done well, he deserves another term, and we will support him to win because he is our man. “Forget about Obasanjo’s letter and his frequent attacks on our president, he cannot stop the president because Nigerians would re-elect him. “He is part of some of the challenges we are facing in the country today, because he did not lay the right foundation when he was president,” he said. Tinubu stated that the exit of some members from the APC would also not stop the re-election of President Buhari,. He said further that the party was unshaken by the defections and was on course to recording victories in the 2019 elections.
