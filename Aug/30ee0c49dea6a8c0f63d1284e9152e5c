Anambra State Signage and Advertisement Agency has issued a warning signal to all aspirants and political parties for the 2019 general elections that it will soon begin to Impound and confisticate branded vehicles that have not been cleared by the agency . The Agency berated the incessant and indiscriminate pasting of election and campaign posters and billboards across the state without paying the state government taxes and rates that go with such outdoor advertisements . Speaking with The Point at Otuocha Township Stadium, Anambra-East Local Government Area , the Managing Director of ANSAA,  Mr. Jude Emecheta, informed all aspirants and political parties that no political party, including the ruling All Progressives Grand Alliance , is exempted from the sanctions over non-payment of advert rates for branded vehicles . He said that in no distant time, the agency will embark on a statewide demolition of illegal billboards and other campaign posters, adding that demand notice would be served and any action to the contrary would lead to the pulling down of such structures. Although, he disclosed that the Agency has embarked on revenue drive to increase internally generated revenue, he equally lamented that the Agency was being shortchanged as people preferred to improvise means of getting their goods and services to the people . Emecheta observed that outdoor advertising has suffered severe setbacks in the state due to the influence of the internet and social media platforms . The MD, however, said that the agency was on course and would ensure that government’s meagre resources were not siphoned through illegal conduit pipes by unscrupulous elements .
