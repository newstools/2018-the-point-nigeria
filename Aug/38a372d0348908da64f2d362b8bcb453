A High Court in Makurdi, Benue State has given a 7-day notice to the impeached Speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly, Mr Terkimbi Ikyange, his Deputy, Mr James Okefe and the Majority Leader, Benjamin Adanyi, to appear before it. Recall that Ikyange was reportedly impeached last month. According to Channels TV, the court summoned the three lawmakers to explain why they should not be committed to prison for contempt and violation of last Friday’s order restraining them from parading themselves as principal officers of the State Assembly. The Judge, Justice Theresa Igoche gave the notice on Wednesday in her ruling on an application brought by the 22 Peoples Democratic Party lawmakers. Igoche also renewed the order restraining the above-mentioned lawmakers from further parading themselves as principal officers of the Benue Assembly. She, however, ordered the police to vacate the Assembly complex.
