Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Tuesday addressed the trending audio message from Leah Sharibu, the lone Dapchi schoolgirl, still held by Boko Haram terrorists. Leah, in the recording which was released on Monday, begged Buhari to come to her rescue. Reacting, Adesina, on Channels TV, said only God knows when Leah Sharibu will be released. Adesina said President Buhari had made a commitment to do anything to rescue the kidnapped girls even if it means paying for their release. He said, “For how much longer, I think that question can only be answered by God. I believe that God is interested in that young girl and will ensure that she is preserved. “I think when that clip that we have is verified, at least one will be sure that it’s her and when that is determined, we should all be glad that she is alive. “When will she return, by the grace of God, the government is working on it and we believe she will be back. “One thing we should always remember as Nigerians is that early in the life of this administration, then it was Chibok girls, the president said that whatever it will take to get the girls back including paying, he would do. It’s on record.” The presidential spokesman however stated that the government did not pay a ransom for the release of Dapchi girls. “That is not confirming that there was payment on Dapchi because the then DG of DSS was categorical the day the girls were brought back and it was in public glare that no a dime was paid for Dapchi girls. On Dapchi, there was no payment,” Adesina added.
