…regrets his membership of APC Twenty-three out of the 24 lawmakers in the Kwara State House of Assembly on Wednesday dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress for the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party. Only one member representing Ojomu/Balogun Constituency of Offa Local Government Area, Mr. Saheed Popoola, is now left in the APC. Speaking on the floor of the Assembly during the defection by the lawmakers, the Speaker, Dr. Ali Ahmad, said that the ruling APC had become factionalised. According to Ahmad, “All the honorable members — except one — have finally changed party to the PDP. This is permitted by the Proviso to Section 109 (1) (g) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “Today, as I and other members of the Kwara State Assembly dump the APC for good, I heaved a sigh of relief. In 2014, I was terribly sad leaving PDP reluctantly with 36 other members of the House of Representatives. “Today, I am the happiest leaving the APC for good. I wish I was never a member of the party.”
