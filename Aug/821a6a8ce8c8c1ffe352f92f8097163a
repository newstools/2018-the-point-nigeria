The African Democratic Congress has reshuffled its National Working Committee. This development was contained in a statement on Thursday by ADC National Chairman, Chief Ralph Nwosu. He explained that the reorganisation was in line with the party’s commitment to developing a sustainable political platform to serve as a model in the country that would produce credible leaders. The statement said Chief Anayo Arinze, the National Publicity Secretary since 2008, is now the National Coordinator, Electoral Matters and INEC liaison. “Arinze is required to use his wealth of knowledge and experience to guard electoral matters and INEC relations to ensure that the ADC leverages on its current position as party of choice to ensure electoral gains”, it noted. Similarly, Mrs. Yemi Kolapo, the former Deputy National Publicity Secretary, has been appointed as the National Publicity Secretary. Dr. Chike Okogwu, a Havard-trained technocrat and human rights activist, is now Deputy National Chairman, Strategy, Innovation, and Change. Also, Justina Abanida, a two-time Secretary to Kogi Government and a lawyer is the new Deputy National Legal Adviser while Abdul Ogar (Nasarawa) an activist and one of the chief promoters of Not Too Young To Run, has been appointed Deputy National Treasurer. “We are certain that these party leaders are perfect fits and will use their wealth of experience to build an inclusive and virile political platform that all members and people of Nigeria will be proud of and enthusiastic to be part of,” the statement added.
