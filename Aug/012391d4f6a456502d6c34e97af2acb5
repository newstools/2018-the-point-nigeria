The National Publicity Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Mr. Bolaji Abdullahi, has resigned from his position. Abdullahi has also dumped the party. He made his decision known in a terse statement he issued in Abuja Wednesday. According to Abdullahi, “Politics is local, and my personal stake in the issue of Kwara makes it incongruous for me to continue to sit as part of the working committee of the party. Clearly, I cannot continue to function as the spokesman of a party whose expectations of that role is incompatible with my personal principles. In the same token, I can no longer justify to myself that I should remain in a party which has now made it clear to the world that the political group that I belong is no longer wanted, and which has hung my membership of that group as an albatross around my neck.”
