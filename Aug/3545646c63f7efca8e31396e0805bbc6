A governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress in Nasarawa State, Hon Musa Muhammed Maikaya, has pledged to take the state to greater heights if voted into office in 2019. He vowed to surpass the expectations of the people of the Nasarawa when given the mandate to administer the state. Maikaya stated this in an interview at the Government House, Lafia, after a political jamboree recently organised by Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura. The aspirant stressed that he would step up on some of the projects that had yet to be completed by the past
government and also embark on policies and programmes that would mitigate the untold hardship in the
state. “What I intend to do is to create a pathway for the state and also consolidate on the foundation of my predecessor by way of involving what it should be. I want to assure you that I will take Nasarawa State above what it should be,”
he said. The APC governorship aspirant further said that for his dreams for the state to be actualized, it would be imperative for him to go back to the drawing board and harness the abundant potentials available in the state. “If we really actualise those potentials and bring them to play, it will elevate the state above the present position,” he said. Maikaya, therefore, called on the people in the state to register and collect their voter’s cards as that would be the only thing means that would make it possible for them to vote in candidates of their choice come 2019.
