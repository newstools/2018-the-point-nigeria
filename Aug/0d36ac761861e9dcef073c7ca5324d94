Popular Juju musician, Mr. Yinka Ayefele has said the Senate President, Bukola Saraki did not promise him any financial assistance. Ayefele, who spoke through his Manager, David Ajiboye was reacting to the alleged claim by the Oyo State Commissioner for Information and Culture, Toye Arulogun. In a Facebook post, Ajiboye wrote: Yinka Ayefele Ltd is using this medium to inform the general public that the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki did not promise Dr. Yinka Ayefele, Fresh FM or its management any amount of money. “Please disregard information being circulated to this regard. It is orchestrated by Toye Arulogun, Commissioner for info and Culture in Oyo State’’. Recall that Ayefele’s music house worth N800m which housed Fresh FM in Ibadan was recently demolished by the Oyo State Government.
