It is still unclear how many of the girls they rescued. Mr. Abdullahi Bego, Director-General Press Affairs to Governor Ibrahim Gaidam said the girls were currently in the custody of the Nigerian military. “The Yobe State Government hereby informs the public that some of the girls at Government Girls Science Technical College (GGSTC) whose school was attacked by Boko Haram terrorists last Monday have been rescued by gallant officers and men of the Nigerian Army from the terrorists who abducted them. “The rescued girls are now in the custody of the Nigerian Army. We will provide more details about their number and condition in due course. “Governor Ibrahim Gaidam, who is very grateful for the gallantry and hard work of the officers and men of the Nigerian Army involved in the operation, is monitoring the situation closely and will make a statement in due course,” ‎he said. The students are expected to undergo medical check-up before proceeding to Damaturu, the state capital. The girls were abducted when suspected Boko Haram insurgents attacked Government Girls Secondary School, Dapchi, in Yobe State.
