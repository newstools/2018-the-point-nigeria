Tragedy struck in Ayila Community in Ogun Waterside Local Government Area of Ogun State as a man identified as Bayo Oluseyi was allegedly killed in a dispute over the stool of the Baale (village head) of the area. Our correspondent gathered that tension had gripped the residents of the area, following a dispute over who should succeed the late Baale of the area, Chief Akinlonu. Trouble began in the community, when the Chairman of the Ogun Waterside East Local Development Area, Mr. Abajo Musa, allegedly imposed one Hon. Akinbote as the new Baale of the community. A member of the community, who did not want to be named, said that the choice of Akinbote as the new baale of the town led to the crisis, which resulted in the death of Bayo. The source further explained that an argument had ensued between OlowosanyejeÂ  and the Akarigbo ruling houses over who should produce the next Baale, throwing the community in the current crisis. It was learnt that most of the residents of the community had fled to neighbouring communities due to the worsening crisis over the stool of the Baale of the town. The lawmaker representing Ogun Waterside, Hon. Adeyemi Harrison, said that efforts were being made to resolve the crisis and assured that peace would return to the
land soon. Efforts by our correspondet to speak with the state Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on the matter proved abortive as he did not pick calls made to his phone.
