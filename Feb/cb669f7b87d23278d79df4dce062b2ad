Oby Ezekwesili, co-convener of the Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) movement, has berated President Muhammadu Buhari for “keeping Nigerians in suspense” over the Yobe school attack on Monday. A total of 94 students of Government Girls Science and Technical Secondary School, Dapchi, in Yobe, are said to be missing after Boko Haram insurgents attacked the school on Monday. But Abdumaliki Sunmonu, Yobe police commissioner, said it had not been established if there was any abduction. Commenting on the incident on Wednesday, Ezekwesili said she hopes a repeat of the kidnap of 276 students of a Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, in Borno, would not occur. She recalled that when the Chibok incident occurred in 2014, what “impaired” rescue action within first 48 hours was the federal government’s “shoddy handling” of the matter. “God forbids that the presidency, President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigerian army continued to keep the public in suspense any further on what really happened two days ago at the Government Girls Science and Technical Secondary School, Dapchi, in Yobe” she tweeted. “God forbids that nothing was at all learned in all these years #ChibokGirls on how federal government should transparently engage the public on matters like the allegations flying about on Government Girls Science and Technical Secondary School, Dapchi Yobe State after a Boko Haram attack. “God forbids that we are indeed missing daughters who went to school once again. God forbids that anything resembling a re-enactment of the torture of the nearly four years of our #ChibokGirlsTragedy has happened to Nigeria. “God forbids this evil in our land this evil in our land a second time.”
