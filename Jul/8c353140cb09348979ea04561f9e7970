Italian Serie A club, AC Milan, are in hot chase for Super Eagles midfield dazzler, Joel Obi, in the ongoing transfer window. The Point gathered that AC Milan are mulling over a move for the Torino midfielder who began his professional football career in Italy with The Rossoneriâ€™s bitter rivals Inter Milan. Obi has entered the final twelve months of his contract with Torino and they are looking to selling him to recoup majority of their previous investment on the player and the fact that he has not been offered a new contract suggests that he is not in the plans of manager Walter Mazzarri for the forthcoming season. Though the 27-year-old had been linked with Premier League club Crystal Palace plus Portuguese duo Benfica and Porto, the most concrete interest has come from Celta Vigo who saw a 5 million euros bid turned down by Torino. Obi was named in Super Eagles squad for the 2018 World Cup but was not listed for any action during the tournament in Russia. He has made 110 appearances in the Serie A for Inter, Parma and Torino.
