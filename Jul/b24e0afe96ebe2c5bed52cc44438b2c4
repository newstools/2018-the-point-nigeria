Operatives of the Department of State Services, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and policemen on Tuesday morning laid siege to the Abuja homes of the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; and Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu. The security operatives arrived at the homes of the two principal officers of the Senate in the early hours of Tuesday. The security operatives at Saraki’s Maitama residence left around 7:30am, when the Senate President was said to have left the premises. The security operatives were said to have, at first, prevented Saraki, who was about to move out of his residence to report to the police, following a new invitation extended to him to show up at their station this morning, from moving out of his residence. But those at the Apo residence of his deputy, Ekweremadu, were still on standby as at the time of filing this report.
