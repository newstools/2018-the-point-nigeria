Heavy security was on Tuesday mounted in every corner of Ado-Ekiti as President Muhammadu Buhari led top-notchers of the All Progressives Congress to Ekiti state for the grand finale of the party’s rally for Saturday’s governorship election in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that it was not easy for people with no direct relevance to the rally to enter the Oluyemi Kayode Stadium, as thorough search and scrutiny were carried out on virtually every passer-by by security personnel. Their activity was complemented by air surveillance by men of the Nigeria Police Force. NAN reports that many residents of the state capital ignored an earlier order by Gov. Ayo Fayose, who in a statewide broadcast earlier in the day, directed them to stay at home and refuse to welcome the president. The governor had also directed residents, especially commercial drivers and motorcyclists, to withdraw their services from the roads. The governor also ordered that public offices and major markets in the city be closed and that residents should stay indoors to slight the visiting president. As a result of the governor’s order, all offices in the State Secretariat were on Tuesday closed. NAN, however, reports that contrary to the governor’s order, many commercial drivers came out to operate, while many market men and women also transacted their businesses. However, those of them in support of the governor acted differently, as they parked their vehicles at the Government House where the governor was holding a counter rally. Fayose said the transporters would remain indoors until 4 pm when the APC rally would have ended. Meanwhile, commercial activities went on normally on Tuesday with a good number of commercial drivers and motorcyclists plying the various routes.
