A fellowship of Christian missionaries, the Northern Missionary Forum, has endorsed the aspiration of Mallam Kabiru Tanimu Turaki for the presidency in 2019. The NMF has its membership drawn from across the states in Nigeria, the United States of America and Taiwan. The Forum’s endorsement came after the 18th Annual Missionary Conference held by the leadership of the Northern Missionary Forum, that of the Global Mission Ministry Centre, Idaho-USA and A Hope For You Foundation, Taipei-Taiwan, at the Centre for Arts and Culture in Abuja. In a copy of a letter to the Peoples Democratic Party aspirant sighted by our correspondent, the National Coordinator of the Forum, Bishop David Ina, explained that “the leadership of the body has declared its unalloyed support for Kabiru Tanimu’s quest to lead the country at this critical period, in recognition of his steadfastness, consistency, commitment to worthy beliefs, and his sterling leadership qualities when he was a Minister and also outside public service.” The Northern Missionary Forum further pledged to support the presidential aspirant’s campaign with intercessory prayer network, grassroots campaign and voters’ mobilisation, as well as donation of assorted materials such as posters, customised note books, lapel pins, stickers, T-shirts and banners, among others. The Forum, however, demanded that the aspirant should make it a priority to work for the good of the people, build and strengthen government institutions, and not individuals, give attention to rural infrastructural development to help the inhabitants fulfill their basic needs and also live a socially and economically productive life, in addition to providing skills acquisition programmes for rural youths and women, especially young widows.
