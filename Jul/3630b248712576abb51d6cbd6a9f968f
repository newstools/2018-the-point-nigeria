Award winning Nollywood star, Rosaline Meuer, is a Gambian-born actress, who is also into modeling. She started her acting career in 2009 with minor roles, but came into the limelight in 2014, when she was featured in the popular movie series ‘Oasis,’ in which she had her first lead role. Her single disposition in the movie ‘Oasis’ attracted recommendations from people in Nollywood as she started getting calls and bookings from renowned producers and directors in Nigeria. Although she had her formative years in Gambia, the beautiful actress, who was born to a Nigerian mother from Delta State and a Dutch father from Holland, has a Diploma in Business Management and is currently studying Photography. Rosy as she is popularly called, has modeled for high profile brands in Nigeria and beyond. Some of her recent modeling jobs are Multisheen Ebony hair products, Calendar modeling, fashion magazines, billboard adverts and popular skin care contracts. For the ever-stunning light complexioned beauty, fashion means a lot. “I like indigenous products, I like to patronize locally made goods. I like good Ankara designs. Fashion accessories add glamour to feminine touch and elegance. The award-winning actress further says looking fashionable isn’t always about wearing the trendiest, most expensive clothes, or mastering some complex styling trick. She believes sometimes it’s as easy as just tucking in your shirt or throwing on your face a pair of sunglasses. According to her, “fashion is all about making a statement and creating a well-defined look and no other accessory does that quite like a good hat, which compliments other accessories.” Mueuer, therefore, says fashion is all about dressing according to what’s fashionable. “A fashionista is always up in the hunt for what’s new and is always ready to try what we call ‘fashion dares or risks’. And this trait simply makes them ultra-stylish,” she says.
