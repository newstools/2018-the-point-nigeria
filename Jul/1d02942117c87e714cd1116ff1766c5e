The Secretary to the Zamfara State Government, Prof. Abdullahi Mohammed Shinkafi, has called on the Federal Government to device a means of regulating activities of citizens on social media. Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the newly elected executives of the Correspondents’ Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists in the state, the SSG decried the activities of some citizens on social media. According to him, the unregulated activities of social media has been posing threat to the government and the governed. “Indeed, we have witnessed an era where proliferation of unethical social media platforms are on the increase. So, journalists have to strive to be careful in their daily reportage,” Shinkafi said. He suggested that government at all levels should regulate the activities of the people on social media to avoid sending out unethical messages that could be injurious to the government and the country at
large. The SSG called for proper monitoring and regulation of social media, so as to avert unguided comments and utterances. He, however, stressed the need for the observance of professional ethics in the reporting of events and happenings in the society, reiterating the support of the state government for the creation of an enabling environment for the media. In his speech, the state Commissioner for Information, Alhaji Sanda Danjari Kwatarkwashi, noted with satisfaction the ongoing good working relationship with journalists in Zamfara. He enjoined the new leadership of the chapel to work hard and cooperate with the ministry in the discharge of their responsibilities. Earlier, the state NUJ Chairman, Comrade Mainasara Muhammad, said the union would always work with the state government in publicising its good policies and programmes for the development of the
state.
