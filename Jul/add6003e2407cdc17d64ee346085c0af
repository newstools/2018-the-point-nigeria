 Former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan on Wednesday held a two-hour closed door meeting with the ex-military president Ibrahim Babangida in Minna, Niger State. Jonathan, who breezed into Minna, the Niger state capital, unannounced, was said to have headed for Babangida’s home by road in a convoy of six black Prado Jeeps. He arrived at IBB’s Hilltop residence at about 10.30am and immediately entered into what a source close to the IBB family described as, ‘a private meeting.’ The source further hinted that the immediate past President came with one of Peoples Democratic Party governorship in Niger state in 2019, Alhaji Hanafi Mu’azu Sudan, and they both rode in the same car from Abuja with Jonathan sitting on the right back seat while Hanafi sat behind the driver. It was learnt that the two were also at the meeting that reportedly lasted for about two hours with Babangida, as Jonathan and his entourage were seen driving out of Minna at about 1pm in the afternoon. Details of the discussion were not known but the presence of Hanafi Sudan at the discussion fueled speculations that it might not be unconnected with the forthcoming primary election of the PDP in the state, where Hanafi Sudan intends to contest. It was also learnt that Babangida had, while the meeting lasted, sent for the state PDP leaders, among whom were the state party Chairman, Alhaji Tanko Beji and the immediate past governor, Dr. Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu. It was further gathered that these state PDP chieftains invited during the meeting were scheduled to meet IBB at the weekend.
