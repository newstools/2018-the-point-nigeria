But four other APC reps defected to the African Democratic Congress. The four APC lawmakers, who defected to the ADC, are from Oyo State, bringingÂ the total number of defection in the House of Representatives to 36. When the Speaker, Mr. Yakubu Dogara, made the announcement, PDP lawmakers went into a wild jubilation.
