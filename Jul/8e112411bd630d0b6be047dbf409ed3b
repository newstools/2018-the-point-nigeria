The Kayode Fayemi Campaign Organisation has condemned Governor Ayodele Fayose’s alleged directive coercing public school teachers to supply their names, phone numbers, accounts numbers and voter card numbers as a prerequisite for the collection of their running grants. A statement by the Director of Media and Publicity of the Kayode Fayemi Campaign Organisation, Wole Olujobi, said the directive was an arm-twisting tactic to coerce the teachers into voting against their will in the July 14, 2018 governorship election. Arguing that the directive was novel in the nation’s electioneering practice, he regretted that Fayose had gone beyond desperation to attempt the sabotage of the nation’s electoral process as laid down in the constitution. The Association of Nigeria Conference of Principals of Secondary Schools in an online message to members on Wednesday had directed all teachers to submit their names, voter cards, phone numbers and account numbers to their zonal chairmen as conditions for the approval of their running grants. The message sent by an unnamed public relations officer of ANCOPSS read, “I am directed to inform all principals, who are yet to collect running grants’ cheques, to obtain clearance from their zonal chairmen. “These clearance is a prerequisite to collecting cheques at the Accounts Department of the Ministry of Education, Ado – Ekiti. “Secondly, all principals are to compile lists of names and voters card numbers of all members of staff latest Wednesday, 27/6/18. “You are to use school letter head paper. It should be duly stamped and endorsed by the principal. Submit same to your zonal chairman for onward delivery to ANCOPSS State Financial Secretary,” the body mandated.
