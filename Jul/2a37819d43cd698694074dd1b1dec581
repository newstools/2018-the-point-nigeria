Chelsea’s squad for the tour of Australia contains three players of Nigerian descent in the shape of Super Eagles left-back Ola Aina, Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori. The Point gathered that Victor Moses and Kenneth Omeruo are yet to report for pre-season and will probably return to Cobham in the next few days and do some fitness tests before they resume training with the squad this week. The two defenders were given an extended break due to their involvement in the 2018 World Cup. England U21 stars Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori, who spent the whole of last season on loan at Swansea City and Hull City respectively, will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of Victor Moses who broke into the first team of Chelsea two years ago after impressing ex-manager Antonio Conte during pre-season. The young striker Ike Ugbo was omitted from the traveling party, fueling speculation he is set to be sent out on loan or added to Chelsea’s U23 team in the new season. Chelsea will face A-League side Perth Glory at the Optus Stadium on Monday, July 23; they will depart to Australia on Wednesday night.
