Thirteen senators of the All Progressives Congress on Tuesday defected to the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party. Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, read a letter from 13 members declaring their defection from the ruling APC to the PDP. The lawmakers include Rabiâ€™u Kwankwaso (Kano-Central), Dino Melaye (Kogi-West), Adesoji Akanbi (Oyo-South), Monsurat Sunmonu (Oyo-Central), Rafiu Ibrahim (Kwara-South), Suleiman Hunkuyi (Kaduna-North), and Lanre Tejuoso (Ogun-Central). Others are Usman Nafada (Gombe), Ibrahim Dambaba (Sokoto), Mohammed Shittu (Jigawa) Isa Misau (Bauchi) Suleiman Nazif (Bauchi) Shaaba Lafiagi (Kwara) and Barnabas Gemade (Benue). Also, Senator Abdul-Azeez Murtala-Nyako (Adamawa) who had earlier dumped the APC for the African Democratic Congress, formalised his defection. Responding to the plea by the Majority Leader, Senator Ahmad Lawan, to the defectors to rescind their decision, Saraki lambasted the APC.
