The Federal High Court in Minna, Niger State, has ordered the interim forfeiture of some assets belonging to ex-Niger governor, Babangida Aliyu. Justice Yellim Bogoro ordered that the assets would remain temporarily forfeited to the Federal Government pending the trial of Aliyu and his co-defendant, Mr Umar Nasko. After hearing the EFCC’s lawyer, Mr. Ben Ikani, who moved the application for the interim forfeiture of Aliyu’s assets, Justice Bogoro made among others, an order “granting the chairman of the commission or any officer authorised by him for the interim forfeiture of two duplexes along Peter Saki Street, Minna, Niger State, belonging to Dr. Muazu Babangida Aliyu, a former governor of Niger State, pending the hearing and determination of this criminal suit instituted against him in charge number, FHC/ABJ/CR/71/2017.” The judge also made a similar order for the “interim forfeiture of a farmland containing a 12-room chalet and four resort buildings located at Birgi Minna, Niger State, belonging to Dr Muazu Babangida Aliyu, a former governor of Niger State.” She also ordered the “interim forfeiture of one Toyota Prado Jeep, one Lexus and two Toyota Land Cruiser Jeeps” which the former governor, allegedly “acquired with proceeds of unlawful act and diversion of public funds.” The judge also ordered the “interim forfeiture of the sum of N57m recovered from Umar Mohammed, the 2nd defendant” and directed that the money be “paid into the commission’s recovery account with the Central Bank of Nigeria.”
