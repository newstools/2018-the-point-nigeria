The Senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District at the Senate, Shehu Sani, has said that he and the other aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress would no longer remain in the party because they were tired of being treated as ‘slaves.’ Sani said the new National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, would have resolved the issues bedevilling the party but assumed power very late. Addressing reporters in Abuja on Tuesday, the lawmaker said, “I wish Adams had come earlier because like I said, these grenades that were laid by the former chairman will explode in a matter of days.” Sani said the party leaders including President Muhammadu Buhari have proved incapable of handling the crisis. Sani said, “It is also very clear to us that even President Muhammadu Buhari is incapable of tackling the menace of the governor of Kaduna state. “How can a governor openly call for violence against Senators and not a statement came from the seat of power cautioning such a governor? “How can a governor move bulldozers and demolish a house of a fellow party member , the one who helped him to be where he is and there is not even a statement from the presidency? “The governor uses the machinery of the state to emasculate political opponents. He even framed me for murder and there was no statement that came from the presidency to caution such a governor. “ Virtually, Kaduna state under governor El- Rufai does not create conducive environment for any of us to remain in that party. “There were three attempts to resolve the Kaduna APC crisis; there was Inuwa Abdulkadir committee which was never respected by the governor, there was the governor Masari-led committee which was also not respected and there is, as you can see, Tinubu’s attempt to reconcile members of the party which was simply naturalized and abandoned. “So we are not slaves to continue to be in that party.”
