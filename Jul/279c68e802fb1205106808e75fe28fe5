Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino is observing at close quarters young Nigerian midfielder Luke Amos in the first few days of pre-season training. The North London club has not hidden their desire to sign Amos who was among the U23 players invited to train with the first team on Wednesday, July 11. Spurs are lacking their full complement of players at the moment, with twelve of their stars summoned to their national teams for the World Cup, including five in the England squad. Luke Amos also trained with the first-teamers for the first time on grass at Hotspur Way. The 21-year-old will be hoping to catch the eye of Mauricio Pochettino in pre-season after a successful loan spell at Stevenage in the second half of last season in which he scored 2 goals in 16 matches. It could be recalled that Amos made the 18-man squad for Tottenhamâ€™s Champions League meeting with APOEL Nicosia in December 2017 before joining Stevenage on loan the following month.
