Doyin Okupe, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has attacked the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai. Okupe was reacting to a tweet where Governor El-Rufai described Peter Obi, the running mate of Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar as a “religious bigot.” El-Rufai recalled that Obi supported his (El-Rufai’s) arrest by the Department of State Services, DSS in 2014 on the ground that “El-Rufai has no business being in Anambra State as it is not Katsina State.” Okupe described El-Rufai as a rabid religious midget. Okupe tweeted, “Peter Obi is a tribal bigot….El-Rufai. “Me: El-Rufai is a rabid religious midget.”
