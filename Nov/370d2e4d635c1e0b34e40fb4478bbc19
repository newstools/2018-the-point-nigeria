Governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State, Senator Magnus Abe, has revealed how the leader of the party in the state, Chubuike Amaechi, humiliated him in the presence of his (Abe’s) wife. Abe, who represents Rivers South East constituency at the Senate, said Amaechi, humiliated him by telling him not to contest for Rivers governor in the presence of his wife. The lawmaker told the Interview magazine that Amechi’s actions may hurt the party badly in the forthcoming elections. Abe said the Minister of Transportion and Director General of the Buhari Campaign Organisation, was running a one-man show in the state’s politics. “My grievances with the transportation minister has nothing to do with him supporting me or not. I have told him clearly that he is free to support who he wants. “My disagreement with him is that he said I should not run, and I said I would run,” he stated. “To come to my house, call me in front of my wife and tell me not to try contesting was the height of it. I said no, I would not accept, I would contest,” he added.
