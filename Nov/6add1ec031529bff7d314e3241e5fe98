  The United States Institute of Peace has predicted that President Muhammadu Buhari will win the 2019 election. This was made known by the organisation in a report it released on the 2019 election saying its report is based on its interactions with Nigerians from different sectors. The report stated that though many Nigerians feel that the current administration has not met their expectations, this is not likely to cost the All Progressives Congress government its hold on power. According to the report; “Important shifts in Nigeria’s political and security context have occurred since the 2015 elections, presenting both evolving, and new, risks to the 2019 elections,” it read. “Of all the state’s institutions, most respondents felt that peaceful elections in 2019 are contingent on the performance of Nigeria’s INEC. “Given the relative success of the 2015 elections, they felt that INEC ought to be able to deliver credible elections again in 2019. However, the fear was that any regression from the level of performance achieved in 2015 could lead to violence because some would view the failings not as a result of incompetence but as deliberate attempts to frustrate the will of the voters.
