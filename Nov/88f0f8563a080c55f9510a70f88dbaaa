Dr Joe Ugwu, a Neurologist based in Abuja, on Thursday said excessive sitting could lead to cardiovascular diseases and early mortality. Speaking to newsmen in Abuja, he said that sitting was a form of inactivity which slows the body’s metabolism, affects the ability to regulate blood sugar, increase blood circulation and break down fat. “Although a slow metabolism is not hazardous to health; it only becomes a problem if one remains seated for a long period of time without any form of physical activity.  “You do not burn calories and the body begins to store up fat. This is when you give room for different kinds of diseases to also be at risk of premature death. According to him, people should balance their way of life through increased physical activity because those who live sedentary lifestyle are prone to die fast. “Where they need to be seated for a long time, they should try to walk around at intervals; also, rather than use elevator they can use the stairs.”  “This will help increase their metabolism and heart rate which is necessary to maintain a healthy life,’’ he said.
