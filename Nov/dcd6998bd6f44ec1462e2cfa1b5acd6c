Presidential Candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party for the 2019 general election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has pledged that if voted in as president, he will give 40% of spaces to the youths, 30 % to women and the balance of 30 % to men. Speaking in Yola at an event organised by the Atiku/Obi Vanguard for Good Governance said that he decided to allocate the largest percentage of power of his government to youths because they form 70% of the voting population in Nigeria. “70 % percent of Nigerian voters are youths and women whom successive administrations have neglected. Successive governments in the country have continued to give prominence to the adults in the running of their governments and they have continued to fail.” He said that his administration will shift emphasis and place Nigerian youths in their rightful places in the scheme of things. Atiku accused the President Buhari-led APC administration of deceitful promises stating that all the youth-related programmes put in place by the government are not being implemented.  This, he said has been responsible for the growing youth restiveness in most of the states of the country.
