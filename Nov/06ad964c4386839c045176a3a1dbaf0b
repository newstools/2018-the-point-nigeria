Due to an ongoing report on social media that the embattled Peoples Democratic Party  governorship candidate in Osun State, Ademola Adeleke, collapsed at the airport in Abuja, his party, the PDP has debunked the rumour, saying the contestant in the last Osun gubernatorial election was hale and healthy. In a statement released to media houses by the Spokesperson of Adeleke Campaign Organization, Olawale Rasheed, the party declared that there was no time Adeleke left Abuja, let alone collapsing at the airport or any other place.
It described the rumour as being totally false and mere propaganda to demean the party’s flag bearer. The statement reads: “Our attention has been drawn to an evil rumour circulating about the state of health of Senator Ademola Adeleke.We affirm that the people’s governor is hale and hearty. “As a distinguished senator and holder of the people’s mandate, Ademola Adeleke has been attending to statutory duties within and outside his constituency in good health and high spirit. There was no time the Senator suffers health failure either at airport or anywhere else. “We, therefore, urge our teeming supporters and the good people of Osun state to ignore any fake news purporting health failure on the part of the Senator. It is a product of warped minds and infantile imagination of usurper of peoples mandate.
“All hands are on deck to regain the mandate of the people freely given on September 22. We owe Osun people that sacred duty.”
