The Baale of Ferowa village in Ifo local government area of Ogun State, Chief Muyideen Folorunso has been arrested by men of the state police command over a dubious land deal worth if #15.5 million. According to DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi,Â PPRO, Ogun State Police Command, his arrest followed a petition written by the management of Jaxmat Homes and Properties that the company approached the Baale for the purchase of about 23 acres of land in his domain which was negotiated for the sum of #15.5 million and the company paid the amount to the suspect after showing the land to them. But surprisingly some months after the payment has been made, the said Baale started selling the same portion of land to another set of people. Before the company knew what was going on, the Baale has sold seventeen acres out of the 23 acres. On the strength of the petition, CP Ahmed Iliyasu directed the officer in charge of public complaints bureau to look into the case and bring the suspect to book. The Baale was subsequently arrested, and on interrogation, he admitted collecting the said amount of money from the complainant after showing them the land. He stated further that it was when he needed some money for his coronation that he was tempted to sell parts of the already sold land. Meanwhile, CP Ahmed Iliyasu has ordered a thorough investigation into the case and the suspect will soon be arraigned in court in accordance with the anti-land grabbing laws of Ogun State.
