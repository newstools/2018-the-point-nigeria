    The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon Mudashiru Obasa has called on Nigerians to imbibe Prophet Muhammad’s tolerance, selflessness and courage to accelerate the growth and development of the country. Rt. Hon. Obasa’s advice was contained in his message to Nigerians in celebration of the birthday of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW). The message, which was released on Monday, was signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Musbau Rasak. According to him, “Prophet Muhammad was tolerant and selfless as a leader and was courageous in implementing programmes which enhanced and ensured improvement of lives of the citizens during his tenure as an administrator. When he was head of government in Madinah, he related well with everyone irrespective of race, religion or creed. That was tolerance! His welfare programmes cater for all, while he was courageous in promoting programmes that enhanced the welfare of the people. These are the qualities we should imbibe”. The Lagos Assembly Speaker stated further that the life of the Prophet is a compendium to learn from to ensure the growth of the country, “and as we celebrate his birthday, I urge us to learn and imbibe such sterling qualities that not only made him the great religious leader but also one of the greatest administrators the world has ever seen”.
