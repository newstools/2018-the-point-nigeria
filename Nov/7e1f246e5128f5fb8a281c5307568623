  The National Association of Nigerian Students has urged government to meet the demands of the unions in tertiary institutions or negotiate with them to come to an agreement in order to ensure students are back in the lecture rooms. Making the appeal was the NANS Zone A Coordinator, Umar Faruk Lawal, during a peaceful protest in Minna tagged ‘Save Education Rally’. They decried the incessant strike in the education sector stating the need for a declaration of a state of emergency in the education sector. According to him, students are not happy with the way the Federal Government has been handling the education. The protest which started from Tunga ended at the city gate and had students bearing various placards reading, “FG should meet up their agreement with COEASU”, “Nigerian students are tired of unstable education”, “Save education save the future”, “stop mortgaging our future”, “Education is the future we have”, “No nation can survive without good education”.
