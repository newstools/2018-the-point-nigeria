  The University of Ilorin has said that it does not charge tuition fees in line with the policy of the Federal Government Tstating that the items that make up the new charges are simply fundamental and basic as they are committed to provision of state-of-the-art health and library facilities, in addition to stable electricity and uninterrupted water supply. Making this known on Sunday in a statement signed by Mr Kunle Akogun, University of Ilorin’s Director of Corporate Affairs, he said there is misinformation currently trending on the social media over slight adjustments in the university’s charges starting from the 2018/2019 academic session. “What we have here is university and faculty charges. The implication is that what is obtainable about 12 years ago can no longer sustain the university in this century. It should be pointed out that even with the slight adjustment in charges, UniIlorin is still among the lowest charging federal universities in the country,’’ he said. He however, noted that this does not foreclose negotiation between the management and student leaders for reasonable concession. “Even if only one naira is added, there will be reaction. “The question is how justifiable is the reaction in the face of current realities in providing qualitative university education with needed facilities that guarantee such. “The management, ever so responsive, has set in motion a high level negotiation with stakeholders for possible reduction,” he said. Akogun also stated that as part of the strategy, a meeting had been scheduled for Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, between the leadership of the Students’ Union, Faculty Presidents and officials of the Students’ Affairs to find a middle course solution to the matter.
