The Nigerian Army has said that it has discovered that Boko Haram terrorists are becoming more daring as they are now using drones and foreign fighters. The Army in a statement signed by Brigadier General Sani Kukasheka Usman said; “We have noticed daring moves by the terrorists, increased use of drones against our defensive positions and infusion of foreign fighters in their ranks. These potent threats require us to continually review our operations. While thanking President Muhammadu Buhari for visiting the troops and some of the wounded officers in the hospitals also commended all patriotic and concerned Nigerians who have sent in messages of goodwill and support for the Nigerian Army. “During the attack, the troops were forced to withdraw and several casualties were recorded. As at date 23 personnel were killed in action and 31 personnel were wounded in action and have been evacuated to several medical hospitals within Borno State.” The Nigerian Army also reiterated and pledged its total commitment to the defence of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “We wish to reassure all Nigerians of the commitment of the Nigerian Army to defend our country at all costs. We shall also continue to remain apolitical, professional and responsive in the discharge of our constitutional roles.”
