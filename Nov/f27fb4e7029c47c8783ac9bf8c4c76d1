A national leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday lambasted the Peoples Democratic Party stressing that Nigeria will not return to the era of greed and selfishness. The former governor of Lagos State made this remark while insisting that no party other than APC will rule in the South-West. He said this during the inauguration of Gboyega Oyetola as the new Governor of Osun State in Osogbo, the state capital. According to Tinubu, “I congratulate Rauf, he had a progressives’ mandate and did it well and renewed mandate and for eight years he successfully handled the administration and today he handed over to another progressives’ governor. “Thank God for working the path. I want to say we have come together and want to say no shaking and no going back to the era of greed and selfishness that had held us back. “We are not going back to the old foxes, scavengers. If they had done anything won’t President Muhammadu Buhari continue it? Look back to the 16 years and tell us what they have done. “Oyetola, we salute you, and we want you to embark on the same path that has brought you. We are solidly with you; just give us a call and we will be with you. No any other party will rule here in the South-West.”
