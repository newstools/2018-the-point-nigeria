   With the Not Too Young To Run Bill, it has been said that Nigerian women and youths should not seat on the fence and watch, rather, they should be part of deciding the political fortune and future of the country.  Giving the advice on Sunday, Miss Charity Idahosa, the only female candidate seeking elective position for the 2019 general election in Edo, has called on stakeholders to create equal opportunities for women, without any form of intimidation, to fully partake in the poll. The Mass Action Joint Alliance (MAJA) candidate for Oredo West Constituency in Edo State House of Assembly, gave the advice in an interview with newsmen in Benin. According to her, electorates should not be deceived by the lies of the two major political parties. “It is time for women and youths of this country to come out and take part in the political development of the nation. “It is not during politicking that you will look for women to dance and sing for other politicians. I am into the race to make a difference. “I have gone round Oredo West Constituency and consulted. I understand the challenges of my people and that is why I strongly feel that they need a strong voice that will canvass good governance and development for the Constituency,” she stated. “In other clime it is a constitutional provision that women have to fill a certain percentage of elective positions not even appointive,” she concluded.
