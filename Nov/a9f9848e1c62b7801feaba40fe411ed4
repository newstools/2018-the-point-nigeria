Investors have been advised by some capital market operators and financial analysts to invest in the shares of the three most traded stocks for the week ended November 16, 2019. The Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Limited, Mr. Ambrose Omorodion, lauded the upward movement of the shares of the top three equities namely Diamond Bank Plc, Ikeja Hotel Plc, and FBN Holdings Plc. He however advised investors to avoid sentiments while taking decisions on where to put their money in the coming year. An asset management analyst, Mr. Oluwasina Kazeem, said that the bullish sentiment was due to early positioning by all classes of market players in low, medium and highly capitalised stocks, ahead of the earnings
season. Kazeem projected that investors would likely embark on profit taking to take advantage of growth recorded by the market in the past few weeks.
