Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hinted on Friday by phone about the Nov. 30 signing at a G20 summit of a new trade deal between Mexico, Canada and the United States, Pena Nieto’s office said in a
statement. Afterwards, the accord would be sent to the legislatures of the three countries, the statement added, without saying which officials would sign the deal known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Pena Nieto is expected to attend the summit in Buenos Aires. Nov. 30 is his last day in office.
