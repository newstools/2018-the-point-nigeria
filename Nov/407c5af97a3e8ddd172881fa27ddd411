Out of the minimum 38 senators expected to carry out legislative activities at plenary on Tuesday, only 20 members were reportedly seen at the red chambers. Though the Minority Whip, Senator Phillip Aduda, who moved the motion for adjournment till next week, citing order 10 (3) of the Senate rules, explained that most of the members were not at plenary because they went on oversight functions, all available facts pointed to the fact that many of the senators were absent in order to enable them carry out necessary preparations for their campaigns starting on Sunday. The Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, seconded the motion for the adjournment, stressing that the order cited by Aduda, barred the Senate from carrying out any legislative duties if members are not up to 38. Subsequently, the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki put the motion to a vote and those present supported it.
