The Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, on Wednesday declared that no army can have enough equipment for its operations. He spoke in response to the recent killing of close to 100 soldiers in Metele, Borno State. He said this at the 2018 Chief of Army Staff Annual Conference in Maiduguri, the Borno capital, with the theme: “Optimising the operational efficiency of the Nigerian Army towards safeguarding democracy and national security in Nigeria,” Buratai said the army has started to strategise to end the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East. According to Buratai: “Internally, there has been violence in some sections of the country, which constitutes security threats to Nigeria’s democracy and existence. The causes of the crises are often for ideological, economic, political, religious and ethnic reasons. “The fight against Boko Haram in the North-East will continue unabatedly. The army is collaborating with Chad and Cameroon, and we are currently conducting joint operations in adjoining areas. “No army can have enough equipment to conduct its operations. So it is incumbent on all commanders to know that we are involved in an asymmetric warfare which calls for dynamism and flexibility.”
