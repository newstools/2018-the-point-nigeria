The Independent National Electoral Commission says it will today make public its investigations on underage voting in Kano. The Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, said this in a text message on Thursday night. He said, “You are all cordially invited to a press conference on the findings of the committee constituted to investigate the alleged Kano Underage Voting scheduled on Friday.” INEC had  in February set up a committee to investigate underage voting in the local government election in Kano State in which the All Progressives Congress won the 44 local governments. The report of the committee which was submitted on March 28, was kept secret for several weeks causing the opposition Peoples Democratic Party to accuse INEC of colluding with the APC-led Federal Governemnt to rig the 2019 elections even before the polls.
