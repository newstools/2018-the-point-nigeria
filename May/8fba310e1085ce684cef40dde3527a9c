Senator Dino Melaye was on Wednesday re-arrested by the police in court after the magistrate court granted him bail. The senator was arraigned before a Magistrate’s Court in Wuse Zone 2, Abuja amid heavy presence of police officers. He was arraigned on charges bordering on his alleged escape from a police vehicle in Abuja on April 24, 2018. The presiding magistrate, Mabel Segun-Bello, granted him bail in the sum of N90m. Melaye’s lawyer, Mr. Nkem Okoro said that his client met the bail conditions granted by the court but the senator was re-arrested by the police on the court premises. “He met his bail conditions but the police decided to re-arrest him on the excuse that they were taking him to Lokoja tomorrow morning,” Okoro said. Melaye laid on a stretcher when he was produced in court in a police ambulance with registration number NPF2214D on Wednesday. Over 200 policemen were deployed to the court on Wednesday. They left the court premises in a convoy which comprised the ambulance conveying Melaye at about 4.20pm.
