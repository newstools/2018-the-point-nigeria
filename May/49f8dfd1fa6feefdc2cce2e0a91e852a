 The Joint Health Sector Union on today called off its 43-day-old strike, directing its members to resume work on Friday. The body also lambasted the Federal Government for failing to meet its demands. The directive was contained in a communiqué issued at the end of the National Executive Council meeting of JOHESU and Assembly of Healthcare Professional Associations in Abuja. The communiqué read in part, “The various gains from the meetings with the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, were presented to the NEC of JOHESU. “After exhaustive deliberations and discussions, the NEC in session approved that the six-week old strike be suspended this day Thursday, May 31, 2018 because of the sympathy the unions have for the suffering Nigerian masses and also to pave way for further negotiations to continue on Monday, June 4, 2018.” The union maintained that the strike was not political but was based on the principle of fairness and justice. It, however, had harsh words for the Federal Government for failing to honour its promise of increasing the salaries of health workers.
