…says ‘N8m is required for her treatment’ A mother, Mrs. Grace Ejide has appealed to public-spirited Nigerians to come to the aid of her two-year-old daughter, Janye Ejide, who is currently battling with a sickness caused by a hole in her heart.
Janye has been rendered inactive by the disease.
Her mother, Grace, told our correspondent that trouble began when her daughter began to fall ill frequently.
“My daughter has a hole in her heart. We realised this in January, 2018. Late 2017, she was down with an illness. When it was getting severe, we were advised to do a test because the way she was breathing was not normal. So, we ran a few tests on her and discovered she has a hole in her heart. She’s always down with malaria, high fever and hot temperature. While she was showing these symptoms, we didn’t realise it in time. It was the doctor that told us to run a test, when he checked the way she was breathing,” she said.
According to her, no one can pinpoint the specific cause of the illness.
“The doctor did not specify what the cause was; all we know is that it is in her body,” she said.
Grace said the family needed N8.5million to get surgery that would close the hole in her daughter’s heart before it would be too late.
“We are currently looking for funds for her so that they can do a surgery to close the hole in her heart. Doctors say we have to do that quickly before she exceeds this age. People are responding, but we don’t have even half of the money yet. We are hoping to get more so that we can save the live of this child,” she said.
