Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, has described parliaments as the last defence of the people against dictatorship. He also called on African countries to invest more in building democracy and it’s institutions. Dogara stated this when he hosted a parliamentary delegation from Liberia, led by Senator Henry Yallah. He said for democracy to be solid and sound, the institutions must be strong as their failure would always be blamed on the parliaments, which failed to rise to their defence. “Democracy as they say is not something that you gain from the ballot box. As a matter of fact, the ballot box sometimes has produced some enemies of democracy, those who have completely discarded the tenets of democracy. “So, we have to invest more in building democracy and democratic institutions. Where Institutions are strong; democracy itself will be made strong. And to be very candid, Parliament are the hope of saving the people from dictatorships. Where democracies fail; it is common place to blame it on Parliament, it becomes the fault of Members of Parliament, who are not willing to stand up to principles and be defenders of those democratic Institutions.”
