Manchester United manager, Jose Mourinho, has insisted he did not drop Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial against West Ham as punishment for their performance against Brighton. Mourinho picked Alexis Sanchez and Jesse Lingard to lead the line for the 0-0 draw at the London Stadium, in the absence of the injured Romelu Lukaku. Rashford and Martial who both started the 1-0 defeat at the Amex Stadium were left on the bench. “Alexis and Lingard didn’t play the last match. We tried to organise the team to get that point but to give opportunities to players to play. “Even the ones who probably play the final, to rest for a couple of weeks is probably not the best preparation for that. “Marcus and Anthony played against Brighton. Today was for Alexis and Lingard and Sunday is a game for Martial and Rashford,” Mourinho said after the West Ham game.
