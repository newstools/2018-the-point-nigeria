Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has revealed what former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Prince Dayo Adeyeye did to him for losing out during the party’s primary election. Adeyeye had lost the chance to become PDP’s governorship flag bearer to Fayose’s deputy, Kolapo Olusola during the party’s primary election. However, Fayose said when he called Adeyeye to accept the result of the primary election in good faith, the former PDP spokesperson cursed him. Fayose’s disclosure was contained in a statement issued on Thursday by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr Idowu Adelusi. The statement reads, “I called Prince Adeyeye twice and on each occasion, he rained curses on me and would not even listen to what I had to say. He said I should never call him again. “I am not afraid of the curses because I know I have not done anything to warrant that or for the curses to have any effect on me. ”By the constitution of our party, I have the right to support anybody for any position, just like I have the right to vote for anybody during elections. I did not hide my preference for my deputy among those seeking to succeed me as governor in our party, so, I was surprised at his reaction. “If it was him that I supported for the position, would he have done that? The process through which our candidate emerged followed due process. I did not interfere with the process and I did not manipulate anything in favour of anybody. “How many state governors have supported their deputies to aspire to be governors? I have nothing personal against anybody and Olusola has been loyal, effective and committed as my deputy and I cannot repay him in a bad manner.”
