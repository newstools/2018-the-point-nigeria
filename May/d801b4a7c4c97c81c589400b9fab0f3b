A Tinubu, Lagos Magistrates’ Court has remanded one Michael Chukwuemeka, for allegedly raping his four underage nieces and a neighbour’s daughter in Lagos.
The alleged serial rapist was remanded by Magistrate F. Dalley, who presided over the case.
He was arrested and charged to court for allegedly having carnal knowledge of his four little nieces and a neighbour’s daughter. The victims are aged: 11, 10, six, five and four. While one is his brother’s daughter, the three others are his wife’s elder brother’s children.
The Point had about three weeks ago exclusively reported how Chukwuemeka defiled his underage nieces and another neighbour’s daughter.
But according to the officials of the Child Protection Network officials, who witnessed the arraignment of the accused in court, when one of the victims (the six-year-old) saw the suspect, she began to shiver with fear and cried out loud.
“The judge quickly took the children into her chamber for questioning and was apparently convinced that they were not telling lies, coupled with the medical report from Mirabel Centre as proof,” the CPN representative, Mrs. Mary-Anne, said.
Having read the medical report and the confession of the minors, Magistrate Dalley, denied the suspect bail and ordered him to be remanded.
“Outside the court, Chukem shouted at the little girls, calling them liars; threatening that they would all die. He cursed my colleague, Ore Adebiyi as well. He said we organised the girls to tell lies against him. But the prison warders cautioned him,” Marry-Anne added.
The matter was adjourned to May 30 for further hearing.
