Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo and Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi could not hold back their tears during the mass burial of two Catholic Priests, Rev Fathers Joseph Gor, Felix and 15 others in Benue on Tuesday. They were among those killed by gunmen believed to be herdsmen in Gwer East LGA of the state last month. Donned in a black kaftan, Osinbajo who tried to fight back emotion during his speech, consoled with people of the state over the unfortunate incident. The VP who was recently in the state, reassured people of the state that the federal government was doing all within its power to end the senseless killings of innocent citizens in the state and other parts of the country. He sympathised with the state governor, Samuel Ortom and the people of the state over the sad and unfortunate incident. He also prayed God to give the bereaved families the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. Amaechi, on his part broke down in tears as he sighted the caskets being lowered into the graves. He was seen repeatedly using a handkerchief to dab his tears.
