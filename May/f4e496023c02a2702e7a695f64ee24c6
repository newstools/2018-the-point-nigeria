As far as Mercy Nnenda Chinwo, popularly known as Mercinda, is concerned, fashion is a value of the impression you create about yourself. For the winner of the 2012 Etisalat Nigeria Idol reality show, everyone, in his or her own right, is fashionable, but being in public eye puts an individual in the spotlight more than every other person. This indigene of Ikwere in Rivers State notes that her fashion is a matter of choice, which is determined more by her mood or the event she is going for. And when it comes to her choice of clothing, mercy says she goes for both the native and Western wears, which she has lately been trying to blend. ”I am a very creative dresser; so far I’m decently dressed and what I wear fits me, I’m good to go” she says.   Regarding her skin care routine, the pretty vocalist says, ”I love to take care of my skin using natural products such as Aloe Vera, coconut oil and moisturizers, as prescribe by my skin care specialist.” For her makeup, Mercinda uses the House of Tara brand and Zaron. Apart from music, Mercinda is also into acting, an added career she dabbled into by chance. ”I travelled to Ghana in 2016 and by chance, met with Yvonne Nelson, who told me about a film entitled, “House of Gold,” which was coming up. I was shy at first, but eventually I performed and came out successful,” she says. She then discloses her plans to go into full time acting in the nearest future. The graduate of Linguistics from the University of Port Harcourt also discloses that she started her music career early in life as a chorister in church before she came into the limelight. Mercinda further discloses that her parents have been supportive of her career choice.
