Zainab Balogun is a Nigerian actress, model and television presenter. She began modeling at an early age after she was discovered at the age of 16.
She has featured in several international campaigns for different brands. She co-founded “The J-ist TV”, an online entertainment web-series that highlights African culture and a range of topical issues; the series features interviews involving some of Africa’s top personalities.
Balogun was born in London, in the United Kingdom to Nigerian parents, where she was raised with a large extended family, predominantly in Clapham, a district in South West London. She’s from Abeokuta, in Ogun State. Due to the nature of her mother’s work, she moved around a lot and spent most of her formative years growing up with relations.
Speaking about her life and fashion, she says, “I am constantly chasing the next opportunity to create something that adds value to my life. I want people to recognise me for my work and contribution before anything else. I believe this has been beneficial in the business relationships and success I’ve had over the years.
“I like fashion and style because one cannot do or live without looking good. Fashion is all encompassing, it reflects the real you and your personality. Fashion tells who you are at a glance. “My mood is probably the most important factor, when it has to do with my fashion interest. I wear what I’m currently feeling. If that’s excited and alluring, then it comes out on the red carpet.”
Balogun, who only tied the nuptial knot last week, stresses that being comfortable in a particular dress plays a huge role in fashion.
“If I can’t stand and look effortless in an outfit for hours, it doesn’t leave the house. I’d rather spend time to dress than hurriedly rush out and looking miserable,” she says.
