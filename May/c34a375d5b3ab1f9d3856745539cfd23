Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Friday said only N100m was spent on the failed attempt to recall Kogi-West lawmaker, Senator Dino Melaye. The INEC chairman disclosed this while responding to questions posed to him at a press conference in Abuja on Friday. Yakubu said the figure was nowhere near the N100bn being bandied by the Peoples Democratic Party. ” A recall exercise is just like conducting a Senatorial election, adding that Kogi-West which Melaye represents, has 552 polling units and seven local governments. “Ad hoc staff were deployed in all the polling units.” Yakubu added.
