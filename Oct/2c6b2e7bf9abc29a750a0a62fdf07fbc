As part of a private venture, MSport Link Africa is set to launch a new initiative against drug abuse, juvenile delinquencies and youths involvement in crime. An official of the body, Chinasa Ukandu told The Point that the new initiative will be officially launched at the secretariat of Lagos State chapter of Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (Lagos SWAN) at Lagos National Stadium, Surulere, on Friday, October 26. Ukandu stated: “The exciting new initiative, Msport Link Africa aims to reduce crime and prevent violence by young people in Nigeria and Africa (aged 16 to 25) by engaging them in supervised football matches and exposing them in different professional clubs in Europe. “Most youths are ready to defy some of the challenges prevailing in the world today such as unemployment and economic hardship, which has reduced them to the level of desperation. “Most of them have given up hopes and have buried their talents and indulge in activities such as drug abuse, crime, and banditry. “It can therefore not be argued that idleness breeds crime and other numerous malpractices that can only lead to the destruction of individuals and their communities. “This official launch will be an opportunity to familiarize all with our operations and present our mission and work plan in the upcoming period.”
