One half of the split music group, P-Square, Peter Okoye, on Saturday, September 22, scooped his first award since he became a solo artiste in 2017. Over the weekend, the singer, who now goes by the name Mr. P, won the 2018 International Achievement Recognition Awards (IARA) for the Best International Male Artist at a ceremony held at the Canary Wharf in London. Although Mr. P regrettably announced his absence at the award ceremony due to his US/Canada tour, he sent a heartwarming shout out to his fans for their support. Peter also dedicated the award to his first son, Cameron, whose birthday was on Sunday. Since after the breakup of P-Square last year, Peter has conveniently settled into the life of a solo act, and has been releasing songs, new videos and performing at numerous shows around the world. “Yes, Guys, we did it! We won!!! My very first award as a solo act! You guys made this happen. INTERNATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT RECOGNITION AWARDS Slow and Steady but surely! God is great To @iara_awards my profound thanks, I was hoping to be in London but as you’re aware, I’m in the middle of my US/Canadian Tour at the moment! I will be by to pick up my award personally.
