 SEKINAH LAWAL President Muhammad Buhari’s wife, Hajia Aisha Buhari has condemned the killings of aid workers as well as many other killings in the country while also encouraging the girl child to aspire higher in life. Also, the first lady advised women to take more active part in farming and other agricultural chains, so as to support government’s efforts towards economic development. She made this known in Abuja while launching the National Gender Action Plan for Agriculture in Nigeria (NGAP) to corroborate the International Day of the Girl Child marked on October 18, every year, believing that the programme will go a long way in supporting women to succeed from subsistent farming to modern agriculture business. The first lady who was represented by the Senior Special Assistant to the President, Dr. Hajo Sani, said; “As we continue to clamour for greater participation in the political sphere, I am not unaware of the marginalization in the just concluded primaries of political parties in Nigeria. I am pained because most of them spent their hard-earned money to be part of the process.” “It is common knowledge that women are good managers and their commitment to the upgrade of the family is noticed. Women contribute 65% of what we eat. We will ensure that they have access to land, improved seeds, fertilizers and loans.”
