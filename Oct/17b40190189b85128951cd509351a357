It was a rowdy session at the Senate on Wednesday over the primaries conducted by the All Progressives Congress in Akwa Ibom State when former Minority Leader, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who defected from the Peoples Democratic Party to the APC just before the primaries, raised a point of order responding to Senator Bassey Akpan (PDP, Akwa Ibom North-East).
Akpan had raised a point of order to tell the Senate about â€Žhow the APC primary allegedly threatened peace in Akwa Ibom. Trouble started when President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki said Akpabio could only speak from the seat allocated to him.
The Majority Leader, Senator Ahmad Lawan and other APC Senators, protested, stating that Akpabio could speak from any seat within the chamber. Meanwhile, Senator Dino Melaye was reportedly seen going about, engaging APC senators in a war of words and efforts by the Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, to settle the matter failed as the chamber became quite rowdy. Akpabio, was said to have demanded an apology from Saraki for embarrassing him which the presiding officer denied.
