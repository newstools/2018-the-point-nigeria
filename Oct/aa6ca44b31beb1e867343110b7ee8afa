As controversy continues to train recently conducted primary election in Kogi State, especially as the several aspirants are calling on the National Working Committee of the APC to serve justice to the Yahaya Bello admiration, the Vice Chairman, House Committee on Ports, Harbours and Waterways Muhammed Kabir Ajanah who represents Okehi/Adavi Federal Constituency at the Green Chamber told our correspondent in Abuja that as part of his post-primaries reaction, he and other aggrieved aspirants have petitioned the primary election, adding that justice must be done to ensure victory of the party in the general elections. “I, some other co-aspirants and our teeming supporters were treated like foreigners in a party we helped to build by these desperadoes to the extent that one began to think if there was going to be APC after the primaries and if our supports would be needed to win elections.” Ajanah who was seeking to represent Kogi Central Senatorial District at the Red Chamber was ousted out at the just concluded primary election which he described as despotic. He said the process was abused by those who are hell-bent at imposing and anointing certain candidates for election in the All Progressives Congress, APC. “Our party delegates were forced to assume that they don’t know how to read nor write, just to prevent them from voting based on their personal conviction about a particular candidate, in essence, their right to freedom of choice was completely denied with effective and accountable representation
threatened. “The lives of some of us were threatened to either withdraw from the race or leave the party. But as a core supporter and ardent follower of President Muhammadu Buhari, I will not succumb to such threat and intimidation but would rather remain in the party to work assiduously to see President Muhammadu Buhari emerge victorious come 2019,” he said. While he urged all his supporters to remain calm and resolute as they await the decision of the National Working Committee, Ajanah said the perpetrators have a date with posterity. “In a land which have produced the likes of late Abdulrahman Okene, revered Abdulmalik Atta, Judith Atta, Aliyu Atta, Alhaji Musa Etudaiye, Professor Nuhu Yakubu, Professor Abere, Professor Angela Okatahi, Professor Akerejola, Professor Aliyu Otaru and host of other eminent personalities, if in this century our people are being maligned to assume that they don’t know how to write, the perpetrators of this act should know that they have a day with Ohiku-Anebira and posterity would never forgive them,” he
added.
