Alhaji Ishaq Hadejia, Chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Jigawa has asked the Minister of Water Resources, Alhaji Suleiman Adamu to resign his appointment as minister with immediate effect. Hadejia stated this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Dutse on Monday. He alleged that Adamu has not been coming for political meetings or activities in the state because he said that he is not a politician. “If that is the reason for the minister, he should better resign; it is because of politics he was given the appointment. “It is really unfortunate that when something happens in the state, whether good or bad, you will never see the minister coming to rejoice or sympathise with the people. “The recent flood which submerged over 500 communities in the state, with 40 deaths including loss of foodstuff, properties, farmlands and live stocks, the minister did not even bother to come and sympathise with the people”. Hadejia stated that Jigawa is an agrarian state full of potentials, and as such, the minister of water resources should collaborate with the ministry of agriculture to harness the potentials in it. He said that Jigawa government is currently spending billions of naira on water projects across the state, but pointed out that the minister could not pinpoint what he has contributed in that regard.
