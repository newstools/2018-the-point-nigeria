One time Chief Justice of Nigeria, Idris Legbo Kutigi, has passed on in a London hospital on Sunday after a brief illness. This was made known by the eldest son of the late elder statesman, Sani Kutigi. According to him, family members are making arrangements to transport him back for burial. Late Kutigi was born on Dec. 31, 1939 and survived by 18 children and over 40 grandchildren. He served as the Chief Justice of Nigeria from January 30, 2007 till December 30, 2009. Justice Kutigi served as the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Niger State until 1976, when he was appointed High Court judge. He served in that position for more than a decade and later joined the Supreme Court in 1992. After 10 years at the Supreme Court, based on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council, former President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed him to the position of Chief Justice to succeed Justice Alfa Belgore, who retired on January 17, 2007.
