Chief Ernest Shonekan, former Head of Government in the Transitional Government and Head of State in the Interim Government is not dead after all. A member of The Point’s Editorial Board, Chief Dayo Onibile, who confirmed this, said: “I spoke with him about 11 a.m this morning to find out the authenticity of the rumour making the rounds across the country and to discuss with him some assignments that I was handling for him. He told me his health was okay. Chief Shonekan returned from the United Kingdom last week where he had his annual medical check-up and was given clean bill of health by his doctors.  “The rumour mill and the social media were abuzz yesterday and up till this morning with stories of his purported death. When media houses were asking me if the story of his purported death was true I decided to ask his personal assistant who said there was nothing wrong with Chief Shonekan. Again, this morning I called Chief Shonekan himself who answered and we both laughed at the fake news of his alleged death being bandied around the social media.  “In Yoruba land, purported death of man who is alive is said to be a sign that the person would live long. Chief Shonekan is the Babasale of Egba land and the father of Egba Anglican Communion.”
