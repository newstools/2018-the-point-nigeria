The national leadership of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has said it has not taken a final decision on who would bear the party’s flag in the 2019 governorship election in Imo State. It, however, disclosed that on November 2nd 2018, its choice between Senator Hope Uzodimma and Governor Rochas Okorocha’s son-in-law would be made known. The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a session with correspondents in Abuja yesterday, said: “The issue of submission of governorship candidates to INEC falls due on November 2nd, so we haven’t reached the stage of where we will submit names or beat the deadline. “You are aware that there was a court action challenging the Imo governorship primary election. The position of the party is that whatever court judgement, good or bad, we must comply with it. “We will only decide who will be APC’s governorship candidate for Imo State by November 2nd.” Meanwhile, Issa-Onilu also decried the allegations against Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and the national leadership as a fallout of the failure of some of the governors and chieftains to project their interests in the party.
