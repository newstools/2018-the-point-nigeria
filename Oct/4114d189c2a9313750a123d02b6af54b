A non-governmental organisation, Concerned Parents and Educators Initiative will on Saturday, October 20, 2018, hold a special appreciation day for teachers. According to the founder, Mrs. Yinka Ogunde, teachers form the bedrock of education reform. Ogunde said, “We cannot talk of reforming the education sector without looking into the welfare of teachers, their training and remuneration. “It is important that government, parents and the society realise that our education sector cannot progress beyond the level of our teaching force.” Ogunde added that teacher’s appreciation day had been designed to encourage and inspire teachers and to demonstrate how valuable they are to the society. Over 500 teachers are expected from both the public and private schools.
