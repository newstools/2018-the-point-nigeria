Following melodrama at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) headquarters in Abuja, former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose has been asked to return N1.3B.
Fayose was questioned over the ongoing probe of the alleged diversion of N4.685billion by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA). Also, he was asked questions over the N1.3billion and $5.377million allegedly traced to him from the N4.6 billion slush funds.
We must recall that Fayose got to the EFCC office in Wuse 2, Abuja, wearing a customised blue Tee-Shirt with the inscription “EFCC I’m here”. Accompanied by his lawyer Mike Ozekhome (SAN), Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike and a former Minister of Aviation Femi Fani-Kayode, he also brought some supporters, some of them wearing white T-Shirts emblazoned with “Fayose, conscience of the nation”
“Nobody should be afraid of the EFCC, especially when you have nothing to hide. I have remained courageous for Nigerians and I will always be with Nigerians.”
Sources close to EFCC said the ex-governor told detectives that he needed to rest, having worked hard for four years and denied all the allegations levelled against him saying he should be taken to court.
 “So far, he has not responded to how he came about N1.3billion and $5.377million from ONSA. He has more issues to clarify; we are going to detain him because he has a lot of issues to clarify.”
“Nigerians were not in the Hobbesian state which was brutish”. “This is a country governed by law and not the rule of the thumb. There should be respect for the constitution,” Fayose’s lawyer, Ozekhome stated.
