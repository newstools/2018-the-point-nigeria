The Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, has directed the Chairmen of the 20 local governments and 36 Local Council Development Areas to engage Private Sector Partnership Operators to resume full operations. He said this when an urgent matter of public importance was raised by Hon. Gbolahan Yishawu, over the menace of refuse scattered all over the state saying that they did not know anything about Visionscape. According to him, there are three arms of government — the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary — and the executive arm ought to have consulted with the House on Visionscape before engaging the company. “We once wrote the Commissioner for Finance, Mr Akinyemi Ashade not to pay Visionscape again and that he would return any money he paid to them after our instruction to the coffers of the government. “We will go to that when the time comes but we have to do the needful now. We call on the 20 local governments and 37 LCDAs to have meetings with the PSP Operators to go back to work and they should start paying them and make the residents to start paying the PSP Operators. We have to avoid epidemics and be proactive,” Obasa said. “I will suggest that we should invite the people in the Ministry of Health and those in the Ministry of the Environment to know their challenges. The refuse situation has become an eyesore in Lagos State. We should invite the people in charge,” Agunbiade said. The lawmakers took turns to decry the poor state of refuse management across the state. The Speaker thereby directed the Clerk of the House, Mr Azeez Sanni, to invite the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Babatunde Durosinmi-Etti, to appear before the House on the matter next week.
