The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps has said that no fewer than six persons died in road crashes along the Toll-gate to Joju Road in Ota, Ogun State, in September. TRACE Zonal Commander in Sango-Ota, Mr. Adekunle Ajibade, said that the increase in accidents in this area was worrisome as majority of the crashes were caused by human errors, while only few could be attributed to mechanical faults. “The TRACE and other sister agencies need to take drastic steps in checking the unnecessary loss of lives and property on our roads. We will continue to educate the public on the importance of safety in order to reduce road crashes in the area,” he said. Ajibade, however, implored motorists to ensure that their vehicles were in order before taking putting them on the road. He also warned them to desist from driving against traffic. He advised motorcycle riders to ensure that they wear crash helmets to prevent them from hitting their heads on the ground whenever accidents occurred. The TRACE zonal commander warned tricycle riders to also desist from overloading to avoid unnecessary loss of lives in the area. Ajibade also advised road users to look carefully left and right before crossing the
highway.
