…set to miss rest of season at Tottenham Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed that Nigeria’s fast rising starlet Luke Amos has been ruled out for the season after rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in a Premier League 2 clash against Blackburn Rovers on September 28. The central midfielder had to make way for Lloyd-Bennett in the 21st minute following the serious injury and the club have announced that he will undergo surgery this week. Amos had been tipped to break into Spurs first team squad after emerging one of their standout performers during pre-season in the United States, where he started games against Roma, Barcelona and AC Milan. The 21-year-old made his professional debut on the opening day of the season against Newcastle United and was on the bench for the 3-0 win against Manchester United. He was rewarded with a new contract in August 2018 which will keep him at Spurs until June 2021. Amos previously enjoyed loan spells at Southend United and  Stevenage. Meanwhile ex-Nigeria U20 international Samuel Chukwueze is making serious waves at Villarreal and was part of the club’s UEFA Europa League squad against Spartak Moscow on match day two. Chukwueze made his professional debut for the Yellow Submarine off the bench in their 2-2 draw with Rangers (Glasgow) on September 20. A few days ago, he played the entirety of Villarreal II’s 4-1 rout of Sabadell in the Segunda B Group 3. Chukwueze was first wanted by Arsenal after displaying his skills at the 2015 Fifa U17 World Cup but it was Villarreal who eventually beat other teams to his signature and the winger is inching closer to a first team promotion despite his limited
experience. The Diamond Academy product showed he is a modern winger at the tournament in Chile, scoring three goals and providing three assists to win the Bronze Boot award ahead of his captain, Kelechi Nwakali.
