… Urge NASS to always pass budget on time Towardds opening new frontiers for family planning, the Development Research and Projects Center, DRPC, in conjunction with the Federal Government and PACFAH@Scale, organised a meeting on updates to states on new family planning policies, policy directions and update from the states on family planning situation and innovations with qualitative assessment of some projects that were implemented to develop and test Community Based Approaches (CBA) to promote family planning. Speaking at the event, the representative of the Minister of Health, Dr Kayode Afolabi revealed that though the maternal mortality rate is reducing in the country, there is still Towards opening new frontiers for family planning, the Development Research and Projects Center, DRPC, in conjunction with the Federal Government and PACFAH@Scale, organised a meeting on updates to states on new family planning policies, policy directions and update from the states on family planning situation and innovations with qualitative assessment of some projects that were implemented to develop and test Community Based Approaches (CBA) to promote family planning.
Speaking at the event, the representative of the Minister of Health, Dr Kayode Afolabi revealed that though the maternal mortality rate is reducing, there is still more to be done.
He said; “We have to look beyond the figures and see how many women are still dying during pregnancy and after childbirth. We can still do better than we are doing now as many deaths can be prevented through contraceptives and child-spacing.”
According to him, we need more awareness creation, demand generation, easy access and buy-in of  family planning among men.
“We need more up take and easier functional last line distribution as well as making health insurance and health care financing matters of critical importance.”
Afolabi made it known that the Federal Government already put in place motions to critically look into the six states with high maternal mortality, see what the challenges are and find a way out of the problems.
“We are making available new contraceptive methods in line with global best practices as well as reviewing of the existing blue print on family planning in order to fast-track access to family planning commodities,” he concluded.
However, barely three months to the end of the year, the $4m FG pledged at the 2017 London Family Planning Summit towards ensuring availability of contraceptives & other FP commodities in LMIC towards meeting the FP2020 goal, is yet to be released due to late passage of the budget by the national assembly. Unfortunately too, we still have less than 4% of the total annual budget going for health and most donations for health matters are from foreign donors. All the stakeholders therefore called on the Federal Government to increase the percentage of health budget substantially in order to meet the varied demands in health sector while also calling on the National Assembly to always pass budget on time because it affects so many plannings. It was also revealed that from the “Basket FP Funding Contribution”, USAID, UNFPA, DFID, Bill and Melinda Gate Foundation and other foreign donors always fulfill their pledges while we have a case of 16.7m US Dollars from the SURE-P program out of which only 1.869m US Dollars was released. The question remains; where’s the remaining amount?
Afolabi called for increased access to funding as continued underfunding of FP and consistent delay in fund release affect adequate planning.
Also speaking, the representative of the Executive Director of DRPC, Dr Emmanuel Abanida, urged all stakeholders to move FP agenda forward through all new frontiers, get familiar with new policy documents, more advocacy, monitoring and financing towards having new narratives and success stories.
Other presentations at the workshop dwell on gender analysis of FP Policies, FP Financing, policy direction and performance indicators and innovative ways of addressing human resources for FP among others.
