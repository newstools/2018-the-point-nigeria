The palace of the Ooni of Ife, Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, has revealed why the king opted for Olori Moronke Naomi Silekunola Ogunwusi. The palace said he married the woman because of the spiritual strength she will bring to the kingdom and the fear of God in her. A statement issued by the Director, Media and Public Affairs of the palace, Comrade Moses Olafare, confirms Naomi as the Ooni’s new wife. He also revealed that the marriage rights were done privately in Akure, Ondo State and she was later received at the Ooni’s palace. “Her Majesty, Olori Moronke Naomi Silekunola Ogunwusi is the new Yeyeluwa Oodua. “Necessary rites fully performed,” the statement read. The monarch also took to social media on Thursday to express his joy. He wrote, “I waited patiently upon the Almighty the King of kings, he eventually did it in the midst of many trials. “Shilekunola, Moronke, Naomi; the greatest Arsenal you can apply on this highly revered throne with many rules and regulations in the midst of undiluted tradition, heritage and culture is the “Fear of God In You”. “It is the beginning of your wisdom on this throne of Oduduwa. You are welcome home my beautiful and adorable queen”.
