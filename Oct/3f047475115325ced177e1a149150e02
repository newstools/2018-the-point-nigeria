Two years after his mysterious disappearance from home, the family members of 21-year-old Emmanuel Lawrence, have declared him missing. The family said that Lawrence got missing in 2016 after some boys suspected to be members of a cult group invaded his father house in Benin, the Edo State
capital. The spokesman of the family, Chief Uyi Lawrence, told our correspondent that at about 7:30pm on the day the 21-year-old boy suddenly disappeared, he was at home alone doing some domestic work given him by his father when the boys invaded the
compound. According to him, "I’m speaking to you now because my house is just the next compound. The boys came in a commando style, shooting indiscriminately; the next thing we saw was fire. As we speak now, the house is completely burnt down. Emmanuel Lawrence has not been seen since then. Whether they took him along with them, killed and dumped him somewhere, we can’t tell.  All our efforts are not yielding any good result. That's why we are also now using the media to draw the public
attention. "We want to draw the attention of the general public to our current predicament. We have reported this matter to security agencies, no positive result; when the state government is mute about the whole situation.  Hence, we are crying out through the media to the general public. "Our son is innocent. He does not belong to any cult group, we can vouch for him. He is gentle and well brought up by the parents.  The worst of it all is that the parents are now homeless.  Their older son is also missing. What a double problem.  We need you the media to help us out." According to Uyi, "All we need is to know whether our son is still alive; that will help to cushion the effect of the problem on the family."
