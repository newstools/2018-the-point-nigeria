Reports making round shows that 35 persons have so far been killed in a clash between Hausa and Adara youths at Kasuwan Magani, Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Those injured were taken to different hospitals located in the heart of Kaduna for treatment. The community has been under different clashes for some time now. Kasuwa Magani is situated in the Southern part of the state, dominated by the native of Adara. The incident reportedly resulted from a disagreement over where traders were to be off-loading their wares for sales during the Thursday market day. But a source with a different version of the story told some newsmen that trouble started when a particular man pretending to be pushing a wheelbarrow stole some goods and was apprehended by some youths. Another version said some of the youths were said to have been angered by the refusal of some of shop owners to allow them drop their wares in front of their shops which led to a verbal exchange that resulted in a free for all. As people took to their heels, some of the youths torched some of the shops which led to commotion in the area. DAILY POST learnt that the security operatives were mobilized to Kasuwan Magani on time to avert further breakdown of law and order. “They were shooting into the air and this helped to disperse the youths, otherwise it would have been worse,” said one of the traders who gave his name as Danladi. The witness said two people died in the latest attack, while many others were wounded. The Public Relations Officer of the Kaduna Police Command could not pick his phone or respond to the text message sent to him.
