Media reports had suggested that Sheriff, a former governor of Borno state, was billed to visit the APC national secretariat, on Thursday, April 26, to officially announce his defection. A statement sent to mediahouses by the national publicity secretary of the party, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, stated that whilst the party was happy to receive new members, membership cards are not issued at the national secretariat.

The statement read: “Our attention has been drawn to reports in some sections of the media that the former factional chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ali modu Sheriff plans to defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) today at the APC national Secretariat in Abuja. “While we are aware of such intentions, we wish to restate our earlier position that anyone who wants to join the party should do so at the ward level. We are happy to welcome new members to our party, but membership cards are not issued at the party national secretariat.”
