Member representing Kachia/Kagarko federal constituency of Kaduna State and Chairman, House Committee on Interior, Hon. Jagaba Adams Jagaba has alleged that former President, Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration paid members of the House of Representatives N500,000 each to impeach the former Speaker of the House, Ghali Umar Na’Abba. He said this on Wednesday while testifying before an FCT High Court in Lugbe in the ongoing trial of Hon. Farouk Lawan who was accused of fuel subsidy bribery scandal in the 7th Assembly . Responding to questions when he was being cross examined by Lawan’s Counsel, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), Jagaba explained to the court that the money was brought by the executive arm of government to bribe members of the National Assembly. He said, it was specifically to impeach the then Speaker, Na’Abba. “I reported the matter to the House during plenary and displayed the money on the floor too. “I displayed N4.5m on the floor of the house because every member was involved. “I believed it was a bribe because I saw trucks coming to distribute the money. It was N500,000 per person. It was nine members that tendered their money as exhibit,” the lawmaker said.
