Ace comedian, Atunyota Alleluya Akpobome, popularly known as Ali Baba, has revealed that Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote has given him the sum of N25 million to be distributed to Nigerians who are interested in doing “better business”. Making the revelation via his Instagram page, Ali Baba also stated that he had been friends with the business mogul for nearly two decades after being introduced to Dangote by a mutual friend 23 years ago. According to Ali Baba, the money can only be won by getting in touch with him via his Instagram page. He wrote, “I have known Aliko Dangote for nearly 23 years now. Met him the first time in the company of the owner of Harka Airline… years ago. And 5 years after that meeting we became friends. “So when I told him I wanted to give out some cash to people who want to do better business, he gave me N25m to distribute this week on Instagram. Only those who need it need to apply. No DMs please. Because in truth… you need to count the number of comments on the Steve Rhodes post (at about 1am today) to know what our problems are.”
