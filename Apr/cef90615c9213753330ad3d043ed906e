Saturday, April 14th, 2018 The minister said the Federal Government was disturbed about the low number of candidates that are seeking admission into its 104 colleges across the country. Adamu said he had to plead with state governments, heads of schools and other interested groups in order to persuade school-age children in the areas with low registration to register for the common entrance examination, adding that a directive has been given so that the portal can still be open for registration until April 13. Adamu said the report of a stakeholders’ meeting that was held recently shown that Zamfara, Taraba and Kebbi states had the least number of candidates who registered for the common entrance examination. While Taraba had 95 candidates, Kebbi had 50. The minister Adamu said the examination would go well as it was planned and enjoined state governments, parents, heads of schools and relevant interest groups in areas to take steps to help the situation.
