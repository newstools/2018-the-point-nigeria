The total value of transactions in the funds market stood at N864.93 billion in the first half of 2017, as against N513.11 billion in the corresponding period of 2016. The Central Bank of Nigeria’s 2017 Financial Market Activity report indicated that the high level of activity in the review period was attributable to liquidity squeeze, occasioned by tight monetary operations. Analysis of the transactions, however, indicated that open-buy-back accounted for 89.42 per cent at N773.42 billion, while the unsecured recorded 10.58 per cent at N91.51 billion. In the preceding year, open-buy-back accounted for less at N203.54 billion or 39.67 per cent, compared to the unsecured segment, which recorded N309.57billion or 60.33 per cent. The shift in patronage in favour of OBB in the review period was attributable largely to greater risk aversion by market participants. The report also showed that loans came in the form of Standing Lending Facility, including the Intra-day Lending Facilities. According to it, the standing facilities were accessed by the banks to enable them, either meet their short-term liquidity needs, or place their surpluses. The rates for SDF and SLF remained at nine and 16 per cent, respectively. According to the apex bank, the SLF was utilised by the banks in order to enable them square up their positions after inter-bank market trading hours. It said of the total SLF granted in the review period, N20.62 trillion was conversion from unsettled ILF. The SLF is an overnight CBN credit available on banking days between 2pm and 3.30pm, with settlement done on same day value. Funds were sourced mainly from time, savings and foreign currency deposits, as well as accretion to unclassified assets. The funds were used, largely, to extend credit to the private sector and payment of claims on demand deposit. According to the report, signed by a Director, Financial Markets Department, CBN, Mr. Alvan Ikoku, the banks continued to access the CBN’s Standing Facilities window to square up their positions, either by borrowing from the SLF window or depositing excess reserves at the standing deposit facility window of the CBN at the end of each business day. It noted that the SLF was utilised by the banks in order to enable them square up their positions after inter-bank market trading hours. The report added that the patronage of the facility reflected the liquidity position during the first half of the year, as requests were at its lowest on January 2, 2017, with N83.61 billion; and at its highest on April 18, 2017, with N478.54
billion. It stated, “In view of the 122 transaction days within the period, average daily request amounted to N225.14 billion. Consequently, the cumulative interest received on the facilities was N21.13 billion at 16.00 per cent. In comparison with the corresponding period of the previous year, total SLF transactions amounted to N5.07 trillion, out of which N4.87 trillion was conversion from ILF.
