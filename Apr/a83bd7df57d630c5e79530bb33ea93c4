Senate President Bukola Saraki said on Wednesday that the Senate was concerned about the health of embattled lawmaker, representing Kogi West in the National Assembly, Senator Dino Melaye. Saraki, who said this when he paid a visit to Melaye at the National Hospital, Abuja, added that the lawmaker had been at the intensive care unit and had not eaten in 24 hours. He was allowed to visit Melaye and other senators at the trauma centre and the meeting lasted for one hour. The Senate President said, “After the sitting at the Senate today, we resolved to come here because for over 24 hours, we have not heard or known about the state of Senator Dino.  We’ve just seen him and he is in intensive care. He’s stable for now. We know he hasn’t eaten for the last 24 hours; we are trying to resolve that. He’s on fluids and he’s being seen by cardiologists, by all specialists.  “As you know he has other (health) issues, he’s asthmatic. We are a bit concerned, but for now we thank God he’s stable. We want to thank the management of the National Hospital, the professional and medical staff for what they’ve been able to do. As for now, he’s stable, he’s being monitored. We’ll continue to pray for him that he continues to recover.” On reports that Melaye was handcuffed to his bed, Saraki said, “He’s not in handcuff.”
