The police have arrested Senator Dino Melaye after a 24-hour siege to his home in Abuja. The embattled lawmaker has been taken to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad facility where he would be grilled for allegedly arming some thugs to disrupt Kogi State. The police had claimed that Melaye was being sought for not honouring the summons extended to him. Melaye had earlier said that he would make himself available to the police today. The senator representing Kogi West disclosed this via his Twitter handle some minutes ago, shortly before he was arrested and forcefully taken away by the police. The police had laid seige to his Shanga, Maitama, Abuja residence since Monday afternoon. They also barricaded the street and prevented visitors from entering the lawmakerâ€™s home. Details later.
