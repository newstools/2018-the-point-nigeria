The Management of the Yaba College of Technology, Lagos, has met with the National Health Insurance Scheme and Health Management Officers to discuss affordable health scheme for students of the
institution.
NHIS is a social scheme intended to provide quality and affordable health service to Nigerians.
According to the General Manager of the scheme, Mr. Femi Akingbade, the NHIS willprovide access to healthcare services, quality and equity of
service.
Akingbade said, “All students must have access to healthcare. Students will be on the Tertiary Institution Social Health Insurance Programme so that while on holiday, any ill student can receive treatment from any registered NHIS hospitals across
the country.
“NHIS wants to partner with Yabatech to sensitise the students on the national scheme and that the scheme is not cheap nor for inferiority purpose, but to provide equal access to healthcare
for all.”
The meeting, which had in attendance HMOS representatives from Marina Medical Service, International Health Management Service and Mediplan Healthcare, also noted that all institutions should participate in the TSHIP programme and not burden parents with healthcare.
One of the HMOs, Dr. Chidi Ukandu also explained that the scheme cost N2000 per student, advising that the deduction be done during the registration for a new session.
“Every student will have a unique identification code, which is tenderable at any registered NHIS hospital and upon graduation, the code becomes disabled. This scheme covers accidents, surgery and cancer chemotherapy treatment as well as other illnesses,” he said.
In his remarks, the Rector, Yabatech, Engr. Obafemi Omokungbe, pledged the college’s support to all students for the programme, noting that previous recommendations by the body on the upgrading of the medical centre’s equipment, the TSHIP awareness programme and the improvement on all other deficient areas were
ongoing.
