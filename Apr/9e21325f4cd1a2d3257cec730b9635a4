The management of the Lagos State University has directed its students to obtain sworn affidavits from the courts pledging to be of good conduct at all times on campus. The institution’s management, in a bulletin released on its official website, said that the directive was issued against the backdrop of the poor attitude, moral laxity and some negative acts displayed by some students of the institution. “In order to maintain good conduct and discipline in the institution, all students are hereby requested to submit a sworn affidavit on or before May 15, as failure to comply with the directive by any student will attract sanctions,” it warned. The LASU management added that it had introduced an International Student Identity Card to serve as a valid proof of identification for its students worldwide. It said that the ISIC registration commenced on Monday and would end on April 30. The bulletin said that ISIC would give LASU students an opportunity to be part of the largest globally recognised, acceptable and verifiable students’ identity. It noted that the UNESCO-endorsed ISIC was a passport for reasonable discount on goods and services for students in selected enterprises globally and it enabled them to pay less on trainings and courses. “It is a single card for identity, payment and access to deep discount worldwide and gives the students an opportunity to save money daily, both home and abroad. It offers discount on travel, shopping, museum, food, entertainment, transportation, education, among others,”
it said. The bulletin said that ISIC also offered scholarship worth 10,000 dollars yearly in partnership with Global Study Awards, British Council, IELTS and Study Portal, adding that students registered under it could benefit.
