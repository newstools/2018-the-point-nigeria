Tragedy struck in Oyo State on Friday morning, as the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Michael Adeyemo, dies at age 47. Adeyemo, a lawyer by profession from Lanlate town in Ibarapa zone of Oyo State, lost his wife to the cold hands of death in 2011. The speaker reportedly slumped and died in his private residence in Ibadan. But a family source, however, said that Adeyemo did not slump, but died in a mysterious circumstance. The late Speaker was in his office at the Oyo State House of Assembly for several hours on Wednesday. Adeyemo presided over the last sitting of the Assembly on Tuesday, and adjourned the sitting of the House till next Thursday, for members to attend to oversight functions before them. On Friday morning, Assembly members had already converged and about to embark on a journey to where they would perform one of the oversight functions, when the sad news came.
