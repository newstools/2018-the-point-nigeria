A former Deputy Speaker, Ogun State House  of Assembly, Hon. Olusegun Gbeleyi, has warned that the Nigerian senate might collapse should the senators, despite their huge allocations, refuse to cater for the welfare of the people. Geleyi, who is contesting for the Ogun west Senatorial District under the platform of the All progressive Party, made this known while speaking with some indigenes drawn from his constituency in Abeokuta, the State capital. The Consultant to Governor Ibikunle Amosun on Energy said that if the senators did not desist from the habit of sleeping or not raising  bills in favour of the people’s welfare at the National Assembly, the people might turn their back against them. He therefore sounded a note of warning to the senators using their office to acquire wealth for themselves that if they did not change their ways, such act might lead to the collapse of the office. He said, “Our people(senators) should understand that acquiring wealth is not going to solve the problem but endanger or collapse the system.”
