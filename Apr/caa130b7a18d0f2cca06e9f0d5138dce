The embattled senator representing Kogi West Senatorial District, Dino Melaye, has reportedly jumped out of a moving police vehicle conveying him to Kogi State and ran into a thick bush. It was gathered that police operatives also gave the fleeing lawmaker a hot chase.  It was learnt that Senator Melaye injured himself in the process and has been rushed to a private hospital. The Special Anti-Robbery Squad were moving Senator Melaye to Lokoja to be paraded later this evening along with some suspected criminals, who implicated him in the crime that necessitated his arrest.
