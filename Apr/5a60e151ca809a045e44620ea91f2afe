For the first time in the history of the Nigeria Premier Basketball League, a team from the South East geopolitical zone, Anambra Flames, is set to compete alongside other clubs from other regions of the country. This is coming on the heels of the club’s qualification at the Division One competition which held in Ilorin, Kwara State where the team came second, getting an elevation to the prestigious NPBL. Although the South East region has produced number of basketball players, playing for other clubs locally and internationally, no home-grown team has ever emerged on the scene to play at this level, prior to the recent feat by Anambra Flames. Describing the hurdles encountered before achieving the feat, the coach of the team, Ifeanyi Modo said Anambra Flames came second in their conference after winning three of their five games, beating some notable clubs. He also stressed the need for corporate bodies and individuals to support the team as they battle for honours at the elite NPBL. “We have some challenges with funds and I really need to let people know, especially people from the South East zone and Anambra particularly. Our team, Anambra Flames is the first basketball team to qualify for the Premier Basketball League in Nigeria from the South East zone, and it would be shameful if they fail to participate in the league due to lack of funds. “Our Director, Paul Ejike Medos, who is an ex-international from Anambra has been trying, bearing the financial burden of the team, which he has fought to bring to the premiership now, but there is little only one man can do, which is why we need the support of everyone at this time. “We hope to sign on new players, get better facilities, and hopefully these would happen when the team holds its recruitment camp in the south east zone to seek fresh and talented players who will make the team.
