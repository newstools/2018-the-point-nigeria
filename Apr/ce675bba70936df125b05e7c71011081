Nollywood and Gollywood star actress, Juliet Ibrahim, did not believe that acting could bring her success as she didn’t see it initially as something she could do. But despite being famous as a movie star, and having won 11 awards in 2015 alone for being a delectable thespian, she is still shy when it comes to acting her movie roles. “I didn’t really take acting as something I would want to do when I grew up because I was very shy. I’m still shy, but I think maturity has helped somehow to cover it up. It’s singing I had always wanted to do. So, when I started acting, it created a platform for me to be able to sing and express myself,” she says. Ibrahim also has the plan to try her hands in music, despite being an actress, and she’s already working on that. “I always wanted to do music like forever, like an average countryside artiste. I started my music career from the church some years back. But I was, however, prepared for a future career in acting at a young age because I also took drama classes and took part in a couple of playlets while growing up in Cote d’Ivoire. But I didn’t know it could bring me into the limelight,” she days. The Ghanaian made her acting debut in a 2005 film, Crime to Christ, starring Majid Michel. Ibrahim’s first Nollywood film was Yankee Boys and she has featured in more than 50 films, afterwards. In 2014, she produced her first film, Number One Fan, where she starred as an actress being stalked by a fan in the film. Her second movie, Shattered Romance, which paraded Nigerian and Ghanaian actors, was launched amid fanfare in Accra, Ghana on December 5, 2014. Her new TV series, Every Woman Has A Story, in which she exhibited her directorial skills, is airing on terrestrial TV and her new reality show, The Perfect Assistant, will be unveiled soon. She has also featured in Twi movies as well as in both Yoruba and Hausa films. The star actress’ first Hausa movie was “Ladan Noma.”
