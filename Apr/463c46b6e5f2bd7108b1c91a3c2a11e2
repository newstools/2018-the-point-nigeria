The question on everyone’s lips now is whether Wizkid is responsible for the filing of a divorce by Tiwa Savage against her husband, Tunji Balogun. When the news initially broke of her divorce issue, people felt it was as a fallout of her messy spat with her husband some three years ago, which led to a separation and then an allegedly quiet reconciliation, which made people believe the storm was over. So, it was a shock when she filed divorce papers. But since no woman will file for divorce, unless she has a valid cause, like she has found someone else she loves, people are now pointing finger at Wizkid as the reason why Savage is seeking a divorce so she can be with him without any legal restrictions. Rumours have been flying for some time and when Wizkid kissed her on stage quite recently at Gidifest, it was like the proof everyone was waiting for; that the two are in love and in a relationship. While some are saying that she’s far older than Wizkid, some are defending them, saying that age is now nothing but a number in relationships. Well, one thing we know for sure is if they are truly in a relationship and are serious about it, they won’t be able to keep it a secret for that much any longer.
