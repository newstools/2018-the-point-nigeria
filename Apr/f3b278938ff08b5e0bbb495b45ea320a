The Ansar-Ud-Deen Society of Nigeria has called on government and well-meaning Nigerians to invest heavily in the education sector. The National Missioner of the society, Alhaji Abdur-Rahman Ahmad, who gave the advice, decried inadequate funding of education by the government, noting that meaningful development would be elusive in the country without huge investment in the sector. Speaking on the topic, “A Transaction that Never Fails,” at the National Special Merit Award of the society held in Lagos on Saturday, the missioner urged individuals to spend their wealth in the way of God, especially in education. He said the world was moving towards the use of knowledge rather than wealth to measure success, adding that those who invested in education stood the chance of becoming rich. He said, “What differentiates human beings from animals is education aside from good manners. In the history of mankind, those who lead the human race are usually the most knowledgeable. I am not aware of any public institution in this country that is well funded.”
