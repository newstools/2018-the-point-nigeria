The family of a retired Chief Superintendent of Police, David Agholor, has been thrown into mourning after the ex-police officer shot himself dead at his residence on Sharaton Estate, Olaogun, in the Ijoko area of Ogun State. Agholor, who was the Officer-in-Charge of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Enugu State Police Command, reportedly shot himself in the head. Sources close to the deceased said thatÂ the family could not explain the reason for his action as he had no history of depression. It was discovered that Agholor had called his eldest daughter last Thursday and handed over the keys to his two houses to her. He was said to have gone to the back of one of the buildings and shot himself in the head. The ex-cop died on the spot.
