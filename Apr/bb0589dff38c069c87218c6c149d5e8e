 …says ‘withdrawal is to promote peace’ An Ado-Ekiti High Court in Ekiti State has discharged and acquitted the chairman of All Progressives Congress in Ekiti State, Mr. Jide Awe, and others, in a murder charge preferred against them. This followed a quest by the state’s Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, that the administration of Governor Ayo Fayose wanted the charge withdrawn. Awe, his aide, and other members of the APC had been on trial for the alleged murder of the late Madam Juliana Adewunmi, and Murphy Jeje, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, in 2013. The late Adewunmi was the mother of Mr. Segun Adewunmi, the current Deputy Speaker, Ekiti State. Ekiti State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Kolapo Kolade, at the High court 7, Ado Ekiti, before Justice Bamidele Omotosho, filed an application for the withdrawal of the case against Awe on Wednesday. He said the state was withdrawing the case in order to promote peace and brotherliness among the people of Erinjiyan-Ekiti, which is the community where both the complainant and the defendants in the matter hailed from. The Attorney-General also said Governor Fayose consented to the withdrawal of the case in spite of political differences because of his belief in posterity, peace and welfare of the people of the community, which was said to have been divided over the court case. The presiding judge, Justice Omotosho, while granting the nod for the AG’s application, said the court supported the development because it was to promote peace.
