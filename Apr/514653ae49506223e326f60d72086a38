The Lagos State University, Ojo, represented by the duo of Dr. Babafemi Babatope and Dr. Abayomi Bello from the Theatre Arts and Music Department, Faculty of Arts, has won the British Council Creative Education Skills Grant. The dons emerged victorious in a keenly contested project, which involved seven United Kingdom higher institutions and seven Lagos State-based parastatals and higher institutions. By this feat, Babatope and Bello became the winners of the prestigious grant for cultural programme between the University of Portsmouth, United Kingdom, and the Lagos State University, which will hold in June this year.
