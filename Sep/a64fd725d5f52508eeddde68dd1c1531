The Senate President has promised that he is ready to work closely with Nigerian youths. This was made known in a release signed by the Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, to Senate President, Yusuph Olaniyonu. He said that it was not the intent of the Senate President to put the Not Too Young To Run group or its leadership in an invidious position. According to him, “The Senate President appreciates the contribution of the group to the development of our democracy and will continue to work closely with young people across the country in order to make Nigeria a better place for all.” He stated that it was brought to their attention that the Not Too Young to Run group issued a statement in relation to the announcement made by the President of the Senate, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki, whilst addressing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members and aspirants of the group. “The occasion was first in a series of Dialogues organised by the Not Too Young To Run along Party lines. The first one is for young PDP aspirants. The subsequent ones are designed for the APC and other parties.” “It is true that the Not Too Young To Run leadership had no prior knowledge of the content of the Senate President’s remarks. However, the announcement by the Senate President that he intends to throw his hat into the ring to contest for the Presidency was made in good faith to young PDP aspirants, partly as a symbolic act of encouragement.” He concluded.
