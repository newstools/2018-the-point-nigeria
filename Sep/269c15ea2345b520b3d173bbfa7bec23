 The Plateau State Government has imposed a dusk to dawn curfew in Jos North and Jos South local governments following the killing of 14 persons in their homes in Rukuba area of the state. Those killed were one child, five men and eight women. They said efforts were made to reach security officials when the attack was going on, but the officials failed to respond until Friday morning. In the early hours of Friday, youths of the community took to the streets, protesting the late response of the military. They mounted barricades preventing motorists and passers-by from accessing the road, but troops of the Operation Safe Haven moved into the area and cleared the barricade. The tension, however, spread to Gada Biu, Katako, Farin Gada and the Jos main market.
