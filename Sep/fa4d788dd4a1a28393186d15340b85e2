One time Kano State Governor, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau has finally dumped the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for All Progressive Congress (APC).
This was made known by his media aide, Sule Ya’u Sule who said that the former governor’s decision to dump PDP was concluded after a heated debate between him and his supporters. Sule said, “ Shekarau has decided to defect from PDP to APC due to the injustice meted on him and his supporters by the PDP leadership. My boss has met with Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in Abuja and concluded plans for our return to APC. He will meet with all the stakeholders concerned in Kano and then made his plans public.” Sule stated that there is no way they could remain in PDP watching the national leadership of the party dancing to the tune of Kwankwaso at the detriment of other PDP big wings.
He said Shekarau had made wider consultation among his supporters before he finally returned to his former party.
