Pharmacist Jimi Agbaje, the 2015 Lagos State gubernatorial candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), on Wednesday, has confirmed his intention to contest for the state’s governorship position. Agbaje revealed this via a telephone interview with newsmen in Lagos. “It is true that initially I did not want to re-contest, but I had so many people urging me to run. “I bought and submitted my nomination form shortly before it closed. I will be part of the PDP Lagos governorship primaries billed for Friday, September, 28th 2018, “ he said. Agbaje said that he was confident he would win the elections in Lagos, if he picked the PDP guber ticket to run. On the upcoming primaries, Agbaje said he was confident that the leadership would create a level playing ground for all the aspirants, as has been the norm of the party. Agbaje, who also contested for the National Chairmanship of the PDP in 2017, won by Uche Secondus, said that the recent defections from the party in the state would not affect him if he picked the ticket. “It is the people of Lagos State that will decide. Most Nigerians now vote for individuals rather than party,” he said. Agbaje, popularly known as JK, was born March 2, 1957 in Lagos State to late Chief Julius Kosebinu (Banker) and Mrs. Margaret Olabisi (teacher). A Pharmacist, Agbaje is the second born and first male child of five children.
