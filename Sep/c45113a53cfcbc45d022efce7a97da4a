 TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Some residents of Peter Ajibola Street of Osogbo, in Osogbo Local Government Area of Osun State where rerun election is slated to hold on Thursday have expressed disappointment at the state government for grading their street road a day to rerun. The road had been in a terrible state and residents of the area had pleaded with the state government on several occasions for its repair but nothing was done. A resident of the area who identified himself as Deola said there was a time the Deputy Governor,  Mrs Laoye Tomori had promised that government would grade it when she visited a church in the area. “We had complained and begged government to attend to this road before now but our requests had been falling on their deaf ears.  We were surprised to see grader and other road construction equipment in our area yesterday night (Tuesday). “This to me is the cheapest political propaganda. Because a rerun is taking place at a polling unit in this area tomorrow, our government now decided to grade road for us. This is disappointing and it shows this government has failed us. If they think we will vote for APC because of this ridiculous road grading, then they have made a terrible mistake,” Adeola fumed. Also speaking, an aged resident, Madam Titilola said though the grading is overdue, it has solved some challenges that the terrible road has been causing residents.  She said; “people are not happy that government is doing it this time that a rerun is a day to be held in our area. To me, it’s a good thing, although long overdue. I wish government could be waking to their responsibilities promptly.” Our correspondent gathered that the people of the Peter Ajibola area had once besieged journalists’ office and cried out over the poor state of their roads. Despite various features authored by this medium, nothing was done until Tuesday when the road grading commenced.
