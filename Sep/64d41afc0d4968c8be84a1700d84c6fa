A mother, Mrs. Mary Usman, has reported a case of defilement of her eight and five-year-old daughters by their father, Mr. Suleman Usman, 37, in the Apapa area of Lagos. The incident was reported by the victim’s mother to the Ben Bruce Foundation on September 14, 2018. Mrs. Usman told our correspondent that her two daughters first complained to her four months ago about some pains in their private parts. “When I questioned them, they said their father used his ‘Chukuchuku’ (penis) in their ‘bum bum,’ but I usually beat them and wondered who was teaching them such a thing,” she said. She further explained that her children kept complaining and crying, but she continued to beat them over their claims. The distraught mother said that the two girls suddenly began to lose weight and became bony. “I complained to the children’s class teacher and the teacher advised I took them to Mirabel Centre for examination, where it was later confirmed that penetration had occurred in their virginas and anuses,” she said. Mrs. Usman said that when the children were further questioned, they disclosed that their father usually sealed their mouths to prevent them from shouting. She said that the older daughter explained that her father usually asked her to kneel over before penetrating her from behind. The mother said that her two daughters alleged that their father was in the habit of carrying them from their room to the sitting room, where he would then ask them to remove their pants and once he was done, he would ask them to go back to bed. Mrs. Usman, however, claimed that she was always fast asleep due to her hectic daily work
schedule. An official of the Ben Bruce Foundation in Eti-Osa, Mr. Ore Adebiyi, said the suspect had been in police custody at the Adeniji Adele Police Station, while the violated children had been taken to a safer  environment.
