 Contrary to expectation, many people defy the sit-at-home order by the Independent People of Biafra, IPOB, with many commercial banks, traders and other business outlets opening for business in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, on Friday. Initially, it was reported that many residents were afraid of transacting any business for the day with major streets deserted. However, later in the day, banks, markets and business premises began to open for the dayâ€™s activities with all government offices and public institutions going about their businesses. However, anti-riot mobile policemen, army, navy and Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps were seen moving through the major streets and flash points in Umuahia. Schools did not open for obvious security reasons. Some of the residents spoken to advised those agitating to be law-abiding and not be too confrontational with the Federal Government. Many residents said that though they believe in the agitation, but cannot stay at home because they depend on the daily sales they make from coming out to transact their businesses.
