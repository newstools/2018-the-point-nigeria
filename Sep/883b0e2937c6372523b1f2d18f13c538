The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has declared Osun State governorship election inconclusive. Thursday, September 27th, 2018, has been fixed by INEC, for the rerun of the Osun State governorship poll. Reasons given by INEC stated that due to some irregularities which marred the election at some polling units in Ife North, Ife South and Orolu local government areas, including cases of faulty card readers, ballot box snatching, among others, this led to the cancellation of 3,498 votes recorded in the affected polling units.
