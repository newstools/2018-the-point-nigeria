Making this known in Lagos on Friday was Dr Adetokunbo Pearse, Chairman, Strategy and Mobilization, SDP, South-West Zone. He said that Ambode would be welcomed to fly SDP’s ticket if his party, All Progressives Congress, APC, denied him second term ticket. Ambode’s second term ticket has been shaky following speculations that he has not been in good book of some party leaders his political godfather, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Tinubu is allegedly supporting a former commissioner in the state, Mr Jide Sanwo-Olu, who has already declared his intention to contest the governorship on the platform of the APC. Sanwo-Olu, the Managing Director, Lagos State Development and Property Corporation, and Femi Hamzat, a former Commissioner for Works, are in the race for the APC’s governorship ticket. “I have to tell you the truth that our national leaders have asked us in Lagos to reach out to Ambode and to let him know that we will be ready to accommodate him in our party if he so chooses. The reason being that Ambode has not performed excellently but we think, he should have an opportunity for second term to complete some of the works he has started. “More importantly, we see Ambode as a man who seems to be standing up to greed. That’s the reason why we feel Ambode should be given an opportunity. They are fighting him because he has not agreed to sell Lagos totally. So, we will welcome him if he comes.” “The National Leader of APC and former governor of the state, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu had made a big mistake by bringing somebody that is totally unknown. They can win the primary (against Ambode) but let it come to the general elections; people will show that this state does not belong to them”. He said: “We understand that it might be difficult to oust the incumbent that has been there for years. We need an alliance and that alliance by the grace of God will come into being. With that alliance we are sure to win 2019 elections for the people and to retire APC in the state.”
