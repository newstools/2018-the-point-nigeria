Following the decision by the National Working Committee, NWC, of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to have direct party’s primary, this has started causing another crisis among the party leadership and some of its members.
The Adams Oshiomhole-led NWC through the National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, issued a statement in Abuja, on Sunday, threatening to sanction members suspected working on a resolution contrary to the direct primary mode approved by the party.
Nabena said; “We want to state clearly that the meeting which has been fixed for 2pm is illegal and an attempt to puncture the sincere efforts being made by the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led NWC to reposition our Party ahead the 2019 General Elections and to ensure unity, equity and justice in the Party.
”The outcome of such a meeting which is already known will be a nullity and we admonish our members to disregard such meetings in the interest of the Party. It is illegal to call such meetings outside the purview of the constituted authority.”
He claimed that the identities of those plotting such meetings have been identified and that “unless they desist from such they will be dealt with in line with the Party’s Constitution at the appropriate time.“
Nabena further said ” The NWC will resist any attempt to disrupt the current peace and harmony prevailing in our great Party after the exit of some members of our Party.
“We urge any member who is not satisfied with the decisions of the Party to utillize channels provided by the Party’s constitution to air their views.
”We remain focused on delivering good governance to Nigerians and above all ensuring the victory for our Party come 2019 and we will not be intimidated by the antics of a few in ensuring success for our Party.” He concluded.
