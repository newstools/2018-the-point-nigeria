… To sanction erring officers The Federal Government has instructed the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) to, with immediate effect; stop the payment of fines by Nigerians holding dual citizenship at the nation’s international airports. In a statement issued by Dr Mohammed Umar, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Interior, the Minister of Interior, Lt. Gen. Abdulrahman Dambazau (rtr), stated that the directive was in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s resolve to make movement easy for Nigerians with dual citizenship to come into their fatherland unhindered. According to him, NIS should ensure immediate compliance with the new government directives as government would sanction any Immigration official found collecting such fines henceforth. “As a new government policy, on no account should any Nigerian traveler holding dual citizenship, pay fine for so-called overstay. It was a crime to ask or pay any money in that regard.” Dambazau stressed that under the new policy, “citizens with dual nationality should only present both traveling documents of their countries of nationality to the immigration officials upon arrival and departure, regardless of whichever they are using to travel.” The minister further directed that Nigerians with dual citizenship should report any Immigration official who imposes such charges on them to the appropriate authorities.
