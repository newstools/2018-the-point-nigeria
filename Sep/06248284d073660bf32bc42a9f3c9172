 Former Ondo State Governor, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, has declared his bid to run for president on the platform of the Labour party in the coming 2019 general elections. Mimiko made the declaration in Abuja on Thursday, at an event held at the National Secretariat of the Alhaji Abdulkadir Abdulsalam-led Labour Party. According to him, there comes a time in the life of a nation where all patriots must stand up to be counted. “I have found it compelling to declare my intention to run for president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. We must use purposeful leadership to halt the wanton killings across the country especially in the Middle Belt.”
