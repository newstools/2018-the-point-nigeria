 Some worshippers were Sunday feared dead while scores of others sustained various degrees of injuries when their church collapsed during service at Adagbrassa in Okpe local government area of Delta State.
The St. Paul Catholic Church located at Adagbrassa, the home town of former Minister of Culture and Tourism, Late Maj. Gen Patrick Aziza, gave way midway into the service. The church drummer, Jeffery Enukanehire, 10 who is one of the deceased, reportedly died on the spot when a section of the building wall fell on him while drumming during a prayer and worship session. Giving details of the incident, his father, Jefferson Enukanehire while lamenting the death of his son, said: “We had just finished the morning prayer for the 7a.m mass when the wall collapsed on my son.” He said: “We had gone for service in company of my wife and five children when the unfortunate incident occurred. “The wall on the left side of the building collapsed and subsequently pulled the other sections of the building down on the worshippers. “My son had succeeded in freeing himself from the initial wall that fell on him when another section of the building fell and crushed him to death.”
