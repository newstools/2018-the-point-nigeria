The Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. David Umahi has appealed to Federal Government to negotiate with and commit treasury looters into subtly surrendering at least 70 percent of the looted funds and keeping the rest or investing all the funds in the country; by so doing, we would have recovered the money and made use of it as many looted funds in Nigeria were in foreign banks, cemeteries and underground where they were being destroyed by termites.
He made this known while declaring open an anti-corruption, ethics and integrity training for Ebonyi State local government officials, held in Abakaliki recently. The Governor advocated amnesty for looters, saying such approach would help in arresting corruption and commit offenders in surrendering over 70 percent of looted public funds.
He promised that in the course of fighting corruption, Ebonyi State government would establish ICPC office in the state. “We have so much of the looted funds trapped in foreign banks, some buried at the cemetery while many were buried underground where they were destroyed by termites. But if there is a negotiation, like committing the looters into subtly surrendering at least 70 percent of the looted funds and keeping the rest or investing all the funds in the country; by so doing, we would have recovered the money and made use of it,” he concluded.
