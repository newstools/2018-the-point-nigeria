The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has postponed its governorship primaries in both Lagos and Imo States indefinitely. Also postponed is that of Kano State. The PDP, however, announced that the governorship primaries in other states taking part in the 2019 election would still be held throughout the country on Sunday. National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, made this public in a statement in Abuja on Saturday night. He said, “The attention of the National Working Committee of the PDP has just been drawn to a rumour making the rounds that the PDP scheduled gubernatorial primary has been postponed. “The PDP wishes to inform all delegates, members of our great party and aspirants for the gubernatorial election that the scheduled date for the primary remains Sunday, September 30, 2018. “The rumour about the postponement should, therefore, be disregarded completely. “However, the gubernatorial primary election dates for Lagos, Kano and Imo states would be announced soon.”
