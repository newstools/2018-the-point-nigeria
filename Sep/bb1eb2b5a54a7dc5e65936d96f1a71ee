National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has said that former Kano Governor, Ibrahim Shekarau’s return to the ruling party was a matter of reunion rather than defection. He said this in Kano noting that Shekarau is one of the founding father of the ruling All Progressives Congress. He stated that the reunion with Shekarau would help advance the position of the party and that of the state and country at large. He said: “Going by the records, nobody is more progressive than the former Minister whose records while in power preceded that of others. “I am most delighted to be at your residence to officially welcome you back to our great party the APC, the party you assisted to form. We know that you would have not committed great amount of efforts in the formation of the All Progressive Congress right from the beginning if you didn’t believe in it, but due to some issues, you had to leave. “I have always said that, going forward, the real progressives would unite and the conservatives would move away. The conservatives have moved away and that offers us a new opportunity for the real progressives to reunite. “I have come to pay my respect to you your excellency, to look forward to working with you and the Governor of the state whose Progressive credentials are also well known.”
