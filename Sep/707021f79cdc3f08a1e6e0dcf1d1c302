… Promises accelerated work pace Following the unending gridlock in Lagos recently, Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has directed workers of the State Public Works Corporation to fix potholes on major and inner roads across the state within the next four weeks. The Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Mr Ade Akinsanya, gave the directive on behalf of Ambode on Friday, during an inspection of the ongoing construction work of Pen Cinema bridge in Agege area of the state. Akinsanya said the fixing of the potholes would bring succour to the generality of the residents. “Due to the torrential rainfall witnessed in the last few weeks, repair works on many roads in the state were suspended. But with the rains subsiding, there was need to intensify efforts in completing ongoing repair works and making roads better across the state. The operation fix the pothole will last for about three to four weeks,” he said. Akinsanya, therefore, appealed to residents and motorists to cooperate by following traffic diversions put in place to ensure the smooth completion of the repair works saying that the state government is committed to the completion of the over 70 projects going on across the state. He said that the Pen Cinema Bridge would be completed by the first quarter of 2019, while the Oshodi/International Airport Road would be delivered by December this year. Akinsanya thanked residents for their patience and assured Lagosians of accelerated work pace.
