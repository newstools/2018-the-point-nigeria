Former vice president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has revealed what will happen should President Muhammadu Buhari refuse to leave office in an event he is defeated in 2019. Atiku, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, said if President is defeated at the polls, he will have no choice than to step aside. According to him, any refusal to step aside and handover power peacefully will plunge the country into political crisis, a situation the President may not want. Speaking on a short interview on a popular online TV, the ex-Vice President said, “Buhari will have to leave power if he is voted out unless he wants to plunge this country into political crisis and I don’t believe he’ll want to do that. “But so far, he has done badly as far as electoral processes are concerned because there have been serious breeches of fundamental electoral processes. “I felt there was a need for someone like me who’s experienced in politics; experienced in governance; experience in business to try and restore and bring back the country on track as far as economic development was concerned.”
