 … Says MAPOLY is in deplorable condition.  SEGUN AYINDE, ABEOKUTA  The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics, ASUP, has raised the alarm that the National Board for Technical Education, NBTE, is yet to reconfirm the accreditation approval of the newly established Ogun State Polytechnics as announced by the state government. The National President, Comrade Usman  Yussuf  Dutse made this known through the Zone C Coordinator of  ASUP,  Comrade Olawale  Omobaorun at a press conference held at the Moshood Abiola Polytechnics, MAPOLY, Abeokuta, the state capital. Dutse said that barely a year after the ASUP of MAPOLY wrote a letter to reconfirm the accreditation approval of the Ipokia Polytechnic as announced by the state government; the NBTE was yet to affirm or debunked the announcement. The ASUP President accused government of deceiving the general public that the NBTE had approved the take-off of Ipokia Polytechnic with a total of 18 courses accredited without requisite class room, office facilities, laboratories and equipment. Dutse lamented that MAPOLY had been in deplorable condition since the NBTE failed to reaffirm the accreditation approval of the new polytechnic at Ipokia, a situation that has stagnated the commitment of staff in MAPOLY. He said; “As staff and stakeholders in the polytechnic education system, the Academic Staff Union of polytechnics (ASUP), MAPOLY Chapter through its national body, wrote to the NBTE to re-confirm the accreditation approval as announced by the state government.” He therefore blamed the government for not being responsible to the salary payment among staff and capital projects in the institution despite the papers submitted by ASUP to the governor through the Commissioner for Education, Mrs Modupe Mujota and the Secretary to the State Government, Barrister Taiwo Adeoluwa but were yet to receive any positive response.
