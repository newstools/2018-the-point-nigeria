 …Shareholders blame CBN’s ‘unwarranted’ fines, charges By Ngozi Amuche  Tough times are really here for banks operating in the country as five commercial lenders in the Tier-1 category suffered a whopping N356.668billion reduction in their shareholders’ funds in the first half of 2018. This came to the fore in the unaudited financial statements recently released by the banks,  with the financial institutions recording  a drop of N356.7billion to post N2, 813trillion in the six months, ending July 2018, against the N3, 169billion reported at the same period in 2017. Shareholders’ funds refer to the amount of equity in a bank which belongs to the shareholders. The affected banks are Zenith Bank Plc, FBN Holding, GTBank Plc, United Bank for Africa and Access Bank Plc. The Point investigation revealed that Zenith Bank led its peers with 12.4 per cent decrease to N719, 505billion in the six months of 2018, from N821.658billion which it reported at the comparable period of 2017. FBN Holding followed with a drop of N660.204billion, from N678, 192billion which it recorded in the first half of 2017. GTBank, on its part, reported N497, 082billion in shareholders’ equity for the first half of 2018, against the N625, 168billion recorded in 2017. Others affected by the slump are UBA, which recorded a drop of N496, 252billion in its shareholders equity (shareholders funds) in the first half of 2018, from N529, 434billion which it released at the comparable period of 2017. Access Bank’s shareholders’ equity also declined by 10.7 per cent to N460, 188billion in the six months ended June 2018, from N515, 447billion at the same period in 2017. Further analysis of the banks financials showed that all the Tier-1 banks in this group reported an impressive numbers in their customer’s deposit, with the exception of Zenith Bank, which shed 7.9 per cent of  its customer deposit to N3, 166trillion in the first half of 2018, from N3, 438trillion which it recorded at the same period last year. Consequently, FBN Holding led with N3.957trillion appreciation in customer’s deposit for the six months, ending June 2018, against N3, 808trillion which the bank reported in 2017. UBA followed with N3, 039trillion customer’s deposit, from N2, 867trillion which it recorded in 2017. Access Bank and GTBank’s customers’ deposit, however, inched up, recording N2, 408trillion, from N2, 244trillion and N2, 268trillion from N2, 062 at the period under review.  Unfavourable regulatory policies Financial pundits, who spoke with The Point,  attributed the gloomy performance to what they described as the unfavourable regulatory policies, which hampers growth and operations in the financial industry. A member of shareholders group, Chief Abayomi Adegoke, said unwarranted regulatory charges and fines are discouraging growth and expansion of the banks. “This is basically the major problem that is affecting our shareholders’ funds. In fact, the way regulators are charging fees and imposing fines on companies is becoming a big risk to our investments in the market,” he said. National Chairman, Progressive Shareholder Association of Nigeria, Mr. Boniface Okezie said both the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Federal Government are not doing enough to encourage the growth of companies in the country. “Rather than creating an enabling environment for more companies to thrive and list on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, government agencies are stunting the growth of companies through their various fines and charges,” he said.  Government agencies playing discouraging role—expert A professor of Economics, Professor Olayinka Oladehinde, expressed displeasure over what called the lackadaisical attitude of the government on the ease of doing business in the country. “It sounds ironic that government and its agencies are playing discouraging roles on the growth of companies in the country through excessive charges and fine. “Instead of using moral suasion in dealing with valuation of such rules, these regulators use punitive measures and various fines. This is not only eating into our investments but is also making some companies to have a second thought, whether to remain listed or go private,” he said. A risk management analyst, Mr. Udechukwu Onuorah, said despite the macro-economic challenges confronting the financial sector, he believes that bank’s fundamentals were still strong enough to withstand present instabilities in the markets, including equities. He added that the improving macro-economic performance will positively impact on the banking industry in the medium to long term, while other indicators suggest likely bargain-hunting in the short term.  CBN on maximum shareholders’ funds CBN, in 2007, proposed the maximum shareholders’ funds of N100 billion for banks operating in the country from N3billion. Under the new regime that replaces universal banking,  three tiers of banks are to come into effect with the lowest shareholders’ funds – N15 billion – set aside for those classified as regional banks. According to the classification, banks with the maximum shareholders’ funds could operate internationally while national banks, whose operations are confined to the country, will be required to have N25billion. On the other hand, regional banks, which are allowed to operate in a minimum of five and a maximum of 10 contiguous states, are required to have N15 billion.
