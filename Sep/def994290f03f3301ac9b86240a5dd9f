 Contrary to rumours going round in some quarters, on the endorsement of a candidate for the Lagos State Governorship position by Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, it has been confirmed that Governor Ambode is still in the race for the All Progressives Congress’ governorship primaries slated for next week. In a release signed by the Chief Press Secretary to His Excellency, Habib Aruna, he said that there is no iota of truth in the news and it did not emanate from the Governor or his office. “We are not oblivious of the desperation from certain quarters that is hell bent on fanning the embers  of discord within the Lagos APC. The giant developmental strides and infrastructural development embarked upon by Governor Ambode in almost three and half years will be completed by him within the constitutionally stipulated time. This is why he has sought the support of party leadership and every Lagosian for re-election in order to complete the good works he has started. He is very much committed to that bid.” Aruna concluded.
