 … Committee to reconvene October 4   Going round Lagos today, our Correspondents reported that all government parastatals beginning from Alausa Secretariat, Ikeja-Lagos, most banks and all public schools were under lock on Thursday in compliance with the organised labour’s directive that all workers should begin strike over delay by Federal Government in concluding negotiation on the new minimum wage. At the Lagos State Secretariat, Alausa, several cars were parked outside the secretariat premises as the enforcement wing of the organised labour set out to work as early as around 7:00 am turning back workers who arrived for work. There were reported cases of partial compliance in most parts of the federation too. Most banks especially around Alausa axis were closed while some opened for skeletal services in some parts of Lagos. However, most private schools visited opened for normal activities. Meanwhile, many fuel stations were seen attending to customers while some wwere doing so with caution for fear of being attacked by hoodlums or enforcement teams of the organized labour unions. Contrary to expectation however, many major roads were still busy with the usual heavy traffic. The labour unions recently demanded for N65, 000 as national minimum wage from the current N18, 000, subject to negotiation by the 30-man tripartite National Minimum Wage Committee set up by government in November 2017. The Minister of Labour, Sen. Chris Ngige, said the tripartite committee would reconvene on October 4, 2018 for further discussion on the matter. Ngige said the meeting would enable the committee continue the negotiation, assuring that the current administration is labour-friendly and would pay the minimum wage once agreed upon.
