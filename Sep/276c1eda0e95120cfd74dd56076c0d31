 The Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, on Sunday paid another visit to the home of former military head of state, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. Though the motive of the visit is sketchy, sources close to Babangida said it is not unconnected with the coming primaries of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP. The Senate President on his facebook page said that; “Before my meeting with PDP delegates and party executives from Niger State, I paid my respects to General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida at his home in Minna.” The presidential aspirant had visited IBB in August, saying on his tweeter account that; “I dropped in to pay my respects to General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, always happy to be with a father and leader.”
