 The Chairman of the National Assembly Legislative Aide Forum (NASSLAF), Comrade Sam Melaye has been arrested. He was arrested during a protest staged over unpaid allowances of the political aides since 2015.
The forum had issued a notice to management over the marginalization of the aides of both Chambers of the National Assembly.
Reports have it that the Senate President, Senator Bukola Saraki earlier held a meeting with the leadership of the body where he assured them that their three years unpaid allowances will be considered but the appealed of Saraki was countered by his Deputy, Ike Ekweremadu, who said the aides have no right to complain over their unpaid allowances since many other Nigerians are looking for jobs.
This sparked anger among the aides leading to the protest where Comrade Sam, younger brother to Senator Dino Melaye, was arrested.
The National Assembly legislative aide forum has also expressed fear over their severance. “If allowances are not paid, then what is our hope that our severance will not be witheld from us? The total figure of the allowances that led to the protest at the complex of the National Assembly is about 800,000 per legislative aide. “The EFCC, ICPC and other relevant security agencies have been called upon to intervene and asked the management of the National Assembly their justification for such deprivation.”
