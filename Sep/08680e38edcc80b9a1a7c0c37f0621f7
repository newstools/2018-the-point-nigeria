  The Kano State Government has announced a direct financial assistance of N100 million to the victims of flood disaster in the state, with a call for the Federal Government’s special intervention to further alleviate the suffering of the affected communities. The State Commissioner for Information, Youth and Culture, Malam Muhammad Garba, who briefed newsmen in his office, said that even though Kano was not among the 12 states the National Emergency Management Agency predicted to have intense flooding, the disaster wreaked havoc on many communities in eight local government areas of the state. He said government is also compiling reports on the extent of destruction from the eight local government areas hit by the disaster to ascertain their value. Garba condoled, on behalf of the state government, with families who lost their loved ones in the disaster and cautioned the public, particularly those in flood prone areas, against building structures on waterways, saying it was one of the major causes of flooding. “The situation required collaboration with relevant stakeholders to give necessary support to the state government in managing the disaster.” Garba concluded.
