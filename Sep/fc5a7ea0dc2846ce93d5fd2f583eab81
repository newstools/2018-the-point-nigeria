 Some of the Civil Society Organisations monitoring the Osun governorship election on Saturday said the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC’s secret balloting had so far made it impossible for people to openly buy and sell votes. The Executive Director of YIAGA Africa, Mr Samson Itodo, said that the group was monitoring the election in 250 polling units. Itodo said that it was obvious that INEC took deliberate steps to ensure that the secrecy of balloting was not compromised. “The polling officials were carrying out voter education in the morning, especially on how to roll their ballot papers according to the election guidelines provided by INEC guidelines. “So, INEC kept to its promise of secret balloting. However, there were still some instances where voters intentionally exposed their ballot, in fact, one actually happened before me. “Itodo encouraged voters to stop doing that, because it would undermine the integrity of the entire electoral process. Also, the National Coordinator, Election Monitor, Mr Abiodun Ajijola said that things were moving as planned except for one or two issues on card readers where it was not authenticating properly. The groups commended INEC for the conduct of the exercise. On the other hand, the Nigeria Police Force reportedly arrested three suspects for vote-buying during the election. The suspects were Muriat Olalekan, 61, Hamzat Muniru, 65 and Adeagbo Wasiu. A statement by the Force Spokesman, acting DCP Jimoh Moshood on Saturday in Abuja, said that the suspects were allegedly arrested in the act of vote-buying. Moshood said the arrest followed the deployment of operatives of IGP Monitoring Unit and the Intelligence Response Team of the Force. The Spokesman said that the sum of N720, 000. 00 was recovered from the suspects. He said investigations were ongoing and the suspects would be arraigned on completion of investigation.
