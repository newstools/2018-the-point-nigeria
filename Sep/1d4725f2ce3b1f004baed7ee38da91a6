  SEGUN AYINDE, ABEOKUTA The All Progressive Congress, APC, in Ogun State, has raised the alarm over fake membership cards, misleading and crooked membership register in circulation across the state. The party raised the alarm in a communique signed by the State Chairman of the party, Chief Derin Adebiyi, and issued at the end of an expanded committee meeting of the party held at MITROS Hall, Abeokuta. Adebiyi said that some confusing and conflicting stories of under-the-table membership were on going in the state and had created confusion in the party which had given the opposition parties the opportunity to infiltrate the rank and file of genuine members of the party. He therefore allayed the fear that some genuine members of the party might be disenfranchised in the coming party primaries. Adebiyi also said that the constitution of the party and the guidelines for the nominations of candidates for the direct primaries in the 2019 general elections has strict pre-conditions for the exercise. “All the prerequisites for a credible, successful and violent-free primary election are absent; only 5 days to primary elections, the updated membership register from across the wards, state, has not been availed the state chapter by the Headquarters.” “The new timetable for primaries from the National Headquarters had directed that the exercise should begin on 25 September, 2018, only five days from now. The constitution of the party and guidelines for the nomination of candidates for the 2019 general elections (direct primaries) contains copious and stringent pre-conditions for the exercise. These include, but not limited to the availability of updated membership register, reliable means of identification of genuine party members and extensive arrangements for crowd control, public order and safety.”
