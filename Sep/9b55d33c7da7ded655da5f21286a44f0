  The Borno Police Command has confirmed the kidnap of a four-year-old son of the Borno State Chairman of All Progressive Congress, APC, Ali Bukar-Dalorin, from his school in the state capital. The Commissioner of Police, Mr Demian Chukwu, made the confirmation on Thursday, while reacting to the incident during a press briefing in Maiduguri. He said the command had launched an investigation to rescue the child from his abductors. “This is a clarion call to all politicians to always watch their back against their opponents. They must be very careful and vigilant at all times. Parents should also monitor their children and report any suspected individuals to the security for prompt action.” He concluded.
