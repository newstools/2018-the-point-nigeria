The National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, has proscribed the presentation of awards by all student union bodies, to individuals and organizations in the country.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the new executives of the association in Abuja, the NANS President, Bamidele Danielson said that such awards to organisations, groups and individuals; had become a source of distraction for students.
He therefore said there is need to restructure the operations of these unions to improve the education system and welfare of members. “NANS has suspended all awards in whatever form to politicians, organisations and others. This suspension is with immediate effect.
“I have placed embargo on all forms of awards till we get it right as an association. I will like to tell the politicians that there is a new sheriff in town.
“The task before us is enormous but surmountable. There is work to be done. The state of our educational system calls for immediate action, bold and swift. And we will act, not only to pressure government to improve learning conditions, but to ensure that government and relevant stakeholders come together to lay a new foundation for academic excellence that will transform our schools, colleges of educations, polytechnics and universities to meet the demands of a new age.”
He also urged the Federal Government to seek more bilateral academic agreements with foreign universities. “There is a need for a new vision and paradigm of higher education, calling for major changes in policies, practices, means of service deliveries and linkages with local and global institutions.”
