Sixteen persons including a People’s Democratic Party (PDP) House of Representatives aspirant Moshood Adejare have been arrested by the police in Osun State for alleged illegal possession of customised Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) tags, caps and jackets. They were allegedly intercepted by a police team at Orolu on stop and search duty. Arrested alongside Adejare were PDP Secretary at Orolu Raimi Taofeeg,  members Oyelayo Dayo and Olaoye Asimi, as well as Gbenga Olapade, Charles Amibiogoiu, Ayomide Ayansola, Kayode Dada and Daramola Segun. Others include Tunji Akinroyinmi, Kunle Adedeji, Habeeb Bahiru, Yisa Sodiq, Adeolu Bamijoko, Oladipo Samson and Adeolu Bamidele. According to the Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIG) Operations and Security Coordinator for the election, Joshak Habila, the suspects had those items inscribed “INEC Osun 2018 Election Observer” and PDP membership cards in their possession. “The suspects are using the items to have easy access to restricted areas meant for personnel with due accreditation,” he said. Habila refuted claims that accredited INEC observers were being arrested or denied access to polling units, assuring Osun people of the police’ resolve to provide security for a free and fair re-run election while investigation continues.
