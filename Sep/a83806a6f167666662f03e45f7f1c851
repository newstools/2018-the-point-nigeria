 … Urges religious leaders to play their roles SEKINAH LAWAL The Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, on Thursday reiterated the need to prioritise education and health while saying that 500,000 graduates had so far been recruited under the Federal Government’s N-power programme. According to him, it is now the business of heads of families to prioritise the education and health of their dependents. The Vice-President, who emphasised the need to invest in people through social inclusion, said that getting the country out of poverty was a task involving planning, physical and discipline. He made known some of these facts at a conference tagged: “Harnessing Demographic Dividend for Sustainable Development in Nigeria: The Role of Religious Leaders,’’ organised by United Nations Population Fund in Abuja. Osinbajo stated that the present administration under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari had introduced various intervention programmes to empower women and youths in order to reduce unemployment and poverty. “About 400,000 Nigerians are currently benefiting from the Conditional Cash Transfer Scheme of the present government…But to avoid ‘the time bomb’, government must build economy that would support the growing population of the country. “This government is committed and determined to take the country out of the current challenges, therefore, religious leaders must play their roles because no real progress will take place without their involvement. “They have strong voice and they have responsibility to hold government accountable to ensure resources go round and meet the needs of the people,” he concluded.
