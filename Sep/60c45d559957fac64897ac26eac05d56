President Muhammadu Buhari has promised to do better if elected as president for another term. The President said this on Friday that if he wins the forthcoming 2019 election, he would do better than he had done before. He stated this during an interactive session with a select group of Nigerian professionals based in the United States and Canada. According to him, his administration had delivered within the available resources. “If I win the next election and I survive the next four years, I will do better.  “I’m always conscious of the ordinary people because they are the ones that always vote for me. A lot of big men have no time to go and queue on the line for hours. “Even pregnant women were on the line for hours and they delivered. They are my constituencies; they always vote for me.
